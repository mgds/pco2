            <p>
                When applying the boron isotope proxy, paleoceanographers make use of the fact
                that higher atmospheric pCO<sub>2</sub> causes seawater to acidify, i.e. its pH
                decreases, and lower atmospheric pCO<sub>2</sub> turns seawater more alkaline, i.e.
                its pH increases. Boron chemistry in the ocean is sensitive to seawater acidity
                and this is recorded in the boron isotope composition of planktic foraminifera. So,
                by analyzing the boron isotopic composition of fossil planktic foraminifera,
                paleoceanographers can reconstruct ancient surface ocean acidity, and translate
                this information into atmospheric pCO<sub>2</sub> if a second parameter of the marine
                carbonate system can be constrained - in addition to temperature, pressure and
                salinity. For a general background, see also note on <a href="/faq/14">General background and some
                commonalities of paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> proxies</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In detail, the sensitivity of &delta;<sup>11</sup>B in marine carbonates is based
                on the chemical speciation of dissolved boron in seawater. Dissolved boron occurs
                in two forms, boric acid (B(OH)<sub>3</sub>) and borate ion (B(OH)<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>),
                and their relative abundance depends on seawater acidity, where boric acid is more
                abundant at lower pH (i.e. more acidic water) and borate at higher pH (more alkaline
                seawater, see Figure a). There are also two isotopes of boron - <sup>10</sup>B,
                which preferentially resides in borate ion, and <sup>11</sup>B, which preferentially
                occurs in boric acid. When seawater pH increases, more and more boric acid is converted
                to borate ion (Figure a), and the <sup>11</sup>B originally present in boric acid
                is transferred to borate ion as well. Consequently, the boron isotope ratio
                (<sup>11</sup>B/<sup>10</sup>B) of borate ion increases at higher pH, and decreases
                at lower pH (Figure b). Boron isotope analyses of marine carbonates have shown that
                they preferentially incorporate borate ion into their shells and skeletons, such
                that their <sup>11</sup>B/<sup>10</sup>B ratio also increases when seawater pH
                is higher and decreases when seawater pH is lower (Figure b). Boron is thereby not
                an essential component of a calcium carbonate skeleton, but it is rather an impurity
                that replaces (i.e. substitutes) carbonate ion (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) in
                the CaCO<sub>3</sub> mineral lattice. As boron becomes a solid component of a
                CaCO<sub>3</sub> shell, it remains locked into the shell after the carrier organism
                dies, and therefore can be recorded in the geologic archive if the fossil shell
                is preserved, e.g., in ocean sediments.
            </p>

            <p>
                As an impurity, boron is not very abundant in marine carbonates, scientists consider
                it a trace element, but there is enough boron present to be analyzed. Scientists
                report the boron isotopic composition of marine carbonates as &delta;<sup>11</sup>B,
                which is the <sup>11</sup>B/<sup>10</sup>B ratio of a carbonate sample relative to
                the <sup>11</sup>B/<sup>10</sup>B ratio of a standard. Because the measured isotope
                differences are small and precise reporting of this ratio would require a cumbersome
                value with 4 decimal places (e.g., <sup>11</sup>B/<sup>10</sup>B<sub>sample</sub>/<sup>11</sup>B/<sup>10</sup>Bstandard =1.0204),
                scientists simplify this term by subtracting 1 and multiplying the ratio by 1000,
                i.e. &delta;<sup>11</sup>B = (<sup>11</sup>B/<sup>10</sup>B<sub>sample</sub>/<sup>11</sup>B/<sup>10</sup>Bstandard -1) x1000.
                The unit of &delta;<sup>11</sup>B is &permil; (per mil or per thousand) and marine
                carbonate &delta;<sup>11</sup>B values typically range between 14 and 30&permil;,
                depending on the carbonate producer (e.g., foraminifera record lower &delta;<sup>11</sup>B
                than tropical corals, Figure b) and on the seawater pH under which the organisms grew.

                            (&delta;<sup>11</sup>B<sub>sw</sub>) is 39.6&permil; in the modern ocean (but
                            has varied in the past). <sup><sup>11</sup>B</sup> is preferentially present in
                            boric acid, <sup>10</sup>B in borate ion. At low pH, when dissolved boron
                            exists in the form of boric acid, &delta;<sup>11</sup>B<sub>boric</sub> acid
                            approaches &delta;<sup>11</sup>B<sub>sw</sub>; at high pH, when dissolved boron
                            exists in the form of borate, &delta;<sup>11</sup>B<sub>borate</sub> approaches
                            &delta;<sup>11</sup>B<sub>sw</sub>. At intermediate pH, when boric acid
                            dissociates to borate ion and H<sup>+</sup>, more and more <sup>11</sup>B is
                            present in the form of borate ion and &delta;<sup>11</sup>B<sub>borate</sub>
                            consequently increases at higher pH. Because marine carbonates such as the
                            skeletons of corals and shells of foraminifera incorporate borate ions, their
                            isotopic composition also increases with pH as
                            &delta;<sup>11</sup>B<sub>borate</sub> increases (grey and black symbols and
                            lines in b). Because ocean uptake of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> acidifies
                            seawater, low pH and low &delta;<sup>11</sup>Bcarbonate correspond to high
                            PCO<sub>2</sub> and high pH and high &delta;<sup>11</sup>Bcarbonate to low
                            PCO<sub>2</sub> (see green arrows at bottom of figure). In ocean regions where
                            PCO<sub>2</sub> and pCO<sub>2</sub> are in equilibrium, atmospheric
                            pCO<sub>2</sub> can be reconstructed from &delta;<sup>11</sup>B<sub>carbonate</sub>.

            <p>
                Paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> reconstruction from &delta;<sup>11</sup>B typically uses shells
                of symbiont-bearing planktic foraminifera, which live in nutrient-poor ocean regions
                such as subtropical gyres. Subtropical gyres are large rotating water masses centered
                around 30&deg; latitude in the northern and southern hemisphere of all ocean basins.
                In subtropical gyres, seawater resides at the sea surface for a long time, which
                allows air-sea gas exchange to reach equilibrium (i.e. PCO<sub>2</sub> = pCO<sub>2</sub>).
                Symbiont-bearing planktic foraminifera are bound to the surface ocean, where enough
                sunlight is available for the symbionts to photosynthesize (e.g., Henehan et al.,
                2013; Hönisch and Hemming, 2005). This fortunate coincidence of a surface ocean,
                low nutrient habitat makes them ideal targets for reconstructing atmospheric
                paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> and alleviates some of the concerns that are central to, e.g.,
                the phytoplankton &delta;<sup>13</sup>C proxy, which often needs to account for
                significant air-sea CO<sub>2</sub> disequilibrium in ocean regions that are productive
                enough to allow sufficient phytoplankton to grow and produce their biomarkers.

                However, like all proxies, the boron isotope proxy is also not free of challenges.
                Such challenges include the uncertainty introduced by foraminifera species-specific
                vital effects on recorded isotope ratios, the relatively poorly constrained boron
                isotopic composition of past seawater (which evolved through geologic time), the
                need for a second parameter of the marine carbonate system (e.g., alkalinity or
                the total concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC), for which scientists
                do not yet command a specific paleo-proxy, and potential diagenetic modification
                of the original proxy signal via partial dissolution of fossil foraminifera shells
                in the sediment. For more information on the boron isotope proxy, see Hönisch et al.
                (2019).

                The B/Ca ratio in planktic foraminifera shells has also been considered as a
                paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> proxy. This proxy is based on the same principle as the boron
                isotope proxy, but it focuses on the dissolved concentration (rather than isotopic
                composition) of borate ion in seawater. As borate ion becomes more dominant at higher
                pH (Figure b), planktic foraminifera incorporate more boron into their shells, and
                this can be measured in their B/Ca ratio. This theoretical basis of the proxy has
                been confirmed in laboratory culture experiments with planktic foraminifera grown
                across a range of seawater-pH (Allen et al., 2012), but Pleistocene sediment studies
                have struggled to observe the expected higher B/Ca ratios during glacial times when
                pCO<sub>2</sub> was lower and surface ocean pH consequently higher. A few seemingly
                successful reconstructions of Pleistocene paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> from planktic B/Ca
                (Foster, 2008; Tripati et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2007) applied either a temperature
                or a carbonate ion correction on the empirical boron partition coefficient between
                foraminiferal B/Ca and the ratio of dissolved borate to bicarbonate in seawater,
                i.e. KD = B/Ca / ([B(OH)<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>]/[HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>]).
                However, this practice of correcting KD for temperature or carbonate ion was later
                found to be based on artificial correlations that produce erroneous results (Allen
                and Hönisch, 2012). The application of KD in B/Ca has henceforth been relinquished
                and published paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> estimates from planktic B/Ca and KD are considered
                unreliable. Pleistocene glacial/interglacial pH shifts appear too small to be detected
                with foraminiferal B/Ca. Additional evidence from culture experiments suggests that
                the pH-effect on B/Ca can be modified by variable concentrations of total dissolved
                inorganic carbon (DIC) in seawater (Allen et al., 2012), possibly opening the door
                to more refined B/Ca – carbonate chemistry translations in the future.
