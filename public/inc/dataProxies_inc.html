          Earth’s geologic history has experienced a range of natural climate shifts that
          provide scientists with valuable information on the overall functioning and
          sensitivity of our climate system to natural cycles and perturbations, but
          geologic climate variables are rarely recorded directly. Antarctic ice core
          records form a rare exception, as enclosed air bubbles allow the direct measurement
          of Earth’s ancient atmosphere going back hundreds of thousands of years. However,
          current atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> exceeds the maximum values recorded in ice cores by more
          than 30%. To provide context for the future, we must look even further into the
          past, to times in Earth’s history when atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> was even higher than it is
          today. To do so, paleoclimatologists use a variety of ‘proxies’, i.e. biological
          and geochemical signatures of past atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> that can be elicited from fossils
          and minerals in terrestrial and marine archives. To learn about the individual proxies
          used for paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> reconstructions, click on the following pictures. Each proxy
          description includes the templates for submitting newly published paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> estimates
          to the database.

          <!-- Climate and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the past cannot be
          measured directly with instruments like thermometers, rain gauges
          or spectrophotometers (i.e. the instrument used for measuring atmospheric
          gas concentrations such as CO<sub>2</sub>). Therefore, paleoclimatologists
          use surrogates (i.e. proxies) for these quantities, which are not
          the environmental parameter itself, but which are closely related
          to that parameter. For instance, different species of plants and
          animals only occur in certain climates, by studying their abundance
          in the past, the climate conditions at that time can be inferred.
          Paleoclimatologists also often study the chemical or isotopic composition
          of minerals or fossil remains of ancient organisms, which change in
          response to the environmental conditions under which those minerals
          were formed and organisms grew. -->
