Similar to land plants, marine algae are also more likely to assimilate the
lighter carbon isotope <sup>12</sup>C over the heavier <sup>13</sup>C, and the
carbon isotopic composition of their biomolecules, &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>phyto</sub>,
is therefore ~10-25&permil; lower than the &delta;<sup>13</sup>C of dissolved
CO<sub>2</sub> in surface seawater. Assuming most of the CO<sub>2</sub> arrives
at the site of photosynthesis by diffusion through the algal cell membranes,
the degree to which algae discriminate against <sup>13</sup>C, commonly expressed
as &epsilon;p, depends on the concentration of their aqueous carbon source;
the more carbon is available, the more selective the algae can be and this will
lower the &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>phyto</sub> (see Figure). This basic theory
has been confirmed in laboratory and field experiments, but the same experiments
have also identified a number of additional factors that can affect
&delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>phyto</sub>, including growth rate, cell size,
irradiance, and the actual carbon source, i.e. carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)
or bicarbonate ion (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>). For instance, the faster algae
grow, the less selective they are in their carbon isotope uptake, so that
&delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>phyto</sub> increases. There have been several attempts
to approximate the degree to which growth rate and other physiological processes
modify the original [CO<sub>2</sub>] signal. In their simplest form, physiological
influences have been summarized by an empirical ‘b’ factor, which relates to
the carbon-specific and enzymatic carbon isotope fractionation as follows:<br>

&epsilon;p = &epsilon;f - b/[CO<sub>2</sub>]<br>

where &epsilon;p is the carbon isotope fractionation between aqueous CO<sub>2</sub>
and &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>phyto</sub> (&epsilon;p ≈ &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>CO2</sub>– &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>phyto</sub>), and &epsilon;f
is the carbon isotope fractionation associated with enzymatic carbon fixation,
which is typically assumed to be constant at 25&permil;. Using this framework,
paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> can be estimated when &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>phyto</sub>
data can be paired with independent estimates of temperature, cell size, growth
rate and &delta;<sup>13</sup>CCO<sub>2</sub>. It should also be noted that one
of the major advantages of the proxy is that the <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C
ratio of biomarkers tends to be preserved well in ocean sediments and thereby
alleviates one of the concerns associated with many paleoproxies, i.e. the
potential modification of the original proxy signal through diagenetic processes.
For additional information, see also General background and some commonalities
of paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> proxies.<br>

The first paleoreconstructions using the &epsilon;p proxy analyzed bulk organic
matter (i.e. all organic carbon in a sample). However, the mixture of different
kinds of algae in bulk organic matter quickly led researchers to focus on long-chain
alkenones (Jasper and Hayes, 1990) which are biomolecules that are produced by a
specific group of marine algae, the haptophytes. Although alkenones are found
throughout the Cenozoic and even the Cretaceous (cf. Brassell, 2014) the current
alkenone-based CO<sub>2</sub> reconstructions are restricted to the past ~40
million years, when alkenones were more abundant in deep-sea sediments
(Pagani et al., 2005b; Zhang et al., 2013). <br>

                The basic theory of the phytoplankton &delta;<sup>13</sup>C proxy
                relates the &delta;<sup>13</sup>C of algae biomarkers to the &delta;<sup>13</sup>C
                of the aqueous carbon source for photosynthesis. This relationship is summarized
                in &epsilon;p, the carbon isotope fractionation associated with photosynthetic
                carbon fixation. &epsilon;p increases when aqueous carbon supply (i.e. CO<sub>2</sub>)
                is high, but also when algae growth rates (&mu;) are slow. <br>

While paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> estimates from alkenones provide significant evidence
for the marked CO<sub>2</sub> decline from the “greenhouse” climate of the
Paleogene, to the “ice house” climate of the Neogene (Pagani et al., 2011;
Pagani et al., 2005a), data younger than 20 million years show much reduced
CO<sub>2</sub> levels and only modest CO<sub>2</sub> change. However, some of
the earlier studies had relied on planktic foraminiferal &delta;18O-derived sea
surface temperature (SST) estimates, that were subsequently recognized to be
largely compromised by carbonate diagenesis (Pagani et al., 2010; Super et al., 2018).
The incorrect, cooler SSTs led to erroneously low CO<sub>2</sub> estimates in
such studies because SSTs are used to determine the temperature-dependent
isotopic fractionation, as well as in Henry’s Law, which relates the aqueous
CO<sub>2</sub> reconstructed from algal <sup>13</sup>C fractionation to atmospheric
CO<sub>2</sub>. Recent studies using temperature estimates unaffected by diagenesis
place average middle Miocene alkenone-CO<sub>2</sub> levels higher
(Super et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2013), and more in line with other proxy estimates.<br>

Despite generally convincing CO<sub>2</sub> estimates during geologic periods of
globally warmer climates, comparisons between ice-core and alkenone-derived
CO<sub>2</sub> estimates over the past 800,000 years suggest that the latter
perform poorly, and have led to questions about the accuracy and validity of
the diffusive uptake of carbon by algae. The presence of active carbon concentrating
mechanisms has been invoked by some investigators (Badger et al., 2019;
Stoll et al., 2019) to explain the low sensitivity of alkenone-&delta;<sup>13</sup>C
to the low CO<sub>2</sub> levels of the past ~20 million years. Others
(Zhang et al., 2019), however, have suggested that study sites with low modern
b values are inherently biased by lower sensitivity of &epsilon;p<sub>37:2</sub>
to changing CO<sub>2</sub>, and that with proper site selection and constraints
on the physiological b parameter, it will be possible to reconstruct relatively
small atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> changes of the late Pleistocene from alkenones. <br>

The systematics of the alkenone &delta;<sup>13</sup>C proxy response to past
CO<sub>2</sub> levels are an area of active research today and ongoing
validation efforts center on evaluating the relative significance of vital
effects associated with haptophyte species assemblages, cell size, growth rate,
carbon concentrating mechanisms (Badger et al., 2019; Bolton et al., 2016;
Bolton and Stoll, 2013; Stoll et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019), and the
fundamental systematics of carbon isotope fractionation in algae (Boller et al.,
2011; Wilkes and Pearson, 2019). Although less research has been done to identify
and evaluate controls other than aqueous CO<sub>2</sub> on other algae biomarkers,
paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> has been estimated from such biomarkers across the entire
Phanerozoic (Freeman and Hayes, 1992; Naafs et al., 2016; Pancost et al., 2013;
Sinnighe Damsté et al., 2008; Witkowski et al., 2018). Based on the information
currently available for the alkenone proxy, other biomarker reconstructions will
have to undergo a similar level of scrutiny to be evaluated in detail.
Depending on the outcome of ongoing studies, re-calculation of paleo-CO<sub>2</sub>
from previously published data may change absolute CO<sub>2</sub> values from
this proxy. However, the major trend in Cenozoic CO<sub>2</sub> estimates from this
proxy, i.e. higher CO<sub>2</sub> prior to 20 million years ago and lower
CO<sub>2</sub> levels thereafter, is unlikely to change and agrees well with other
proxy estimates for CO<sub>2</sub> over this time interval. <br>
