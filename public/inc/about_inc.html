                This website is the result of an NSF-funded Research Coordination Network that
                brings together experts in paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> reconstructions from terrestrial and marine
                archives. Three workshops were held between 2017 and 2019, whose attendees were
                either invited based on their publication record or in response to an international
                call for applications. Nearly 100 scientists have contributed to discussing
                published paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> reconstructions, differences between reconstructions and
                their respective proxies, and to establishing the paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> database that now
                lays the foundation for this website. Published paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> records have been vetted
                by respective proxy experts who screened the data and analytical methods for their
                conformity to current proxy understanding. Some data have been ‘quarantined’ because
                the raw data can either no longer be recovered, the analytical procedures were
                insufficient to account for complications discovered later in the proxy validation
                process, or because the raw data under-constrain individual reconstructions. Some
                earlier CO<sub>2</sub> estimates have been recalculated to provide procedural consistency,
                including 95% confidence limits on all CO<sub>2</sub> estimates. The data product will evolve
                with time, by adding new data, recovering quarantined data with new auxiliary data
                constraints, and continued vetting of published data as our proxy understanding
                evolves.

                While the release of the vetted data product awaits publication of the detailed
                vetting process and analysis of the current Cenozoic paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> compilation, the
                archive data compilation of originally published paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> estimates provides a
                first view of upcoming website functionality and data accessibility. We also invite
                new and experienced paleobarometry colleagues to join these efforts, by submitting
                new data and providing critical assessments of proxies and procedures. The data
                templates provided on the individual proxy pages can already be used to add new data
                to the compilation, to improve their accessibility and citation by interested
                parties, and guarantee their longevity in this diverse and rapidly growing field
                of research.

                This website and database would not exist without the vision of the
                steering committee of the original NSF-funded Research Coordination Network,
                which is composed of Allison Baczynski (Pennsylvania State University), Gabe Bowen
                (University of Utah), Dan Breecker (University of Texas), Rob DeConto (University of
                Massachusetts), Kate Freeman (Pennsylvania State University), Bärbel Hönisch
                (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory), Matt Huber (University of New Hampshire), Matt
                Kohn (Boise State University), Ann Pearson (Harvard University), Pratigya Polissar
                (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and UC Santa Cruz), Christina Ravelo (UC Santa Cruz),
                Andy Ridgwell (UC Riverside), Yair Rosenthal (Rutgers University), Dana Royer
                (Wesleyan University), Katie Snell (University of Colorado Boulder) and Richard
                Zeebe (University of Hawaii). Generous funding was provided by the Heising-Simons
                Foundation to Bärbel Hönisch (Heising-Simons 2018-0996) and National Science
                Foundation to Bärbel Hönisch and Pratigya Polissar (NSF OCE 16-36005).
