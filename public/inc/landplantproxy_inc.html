                Depending on their photosynthetic pathways, land plants can be categorized into
                C<sub>3</sub> (trees, shrubs, herbs, and cool climate grasses such as wheat),
                C<sub>4</sub> (warm climate grasses such as corn and sugar cane) and CAM (i.e.
                Crassulacean Acid Metabolism; succulents such as cactus and jade plant). About
                85% of the land plant species on the Earth’s surface today are C<sub>3</sub>.
                In C<sub>3</sub> plants, the initial photosynthetic carbon assimilation product
                is 3-phosphoglycerate (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>O<sub>7</sub>P, i.e., a molecule with 3 carbon atoms);
                C<sub>4</sub> plants produce malic acid (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, with 4 carbon atoms).
                C<sub>3</sub> land plants have played an important role in the global carbon cycle
                since the rise of vascular plants (i.e. over the past ~400 million years).
            </p><p>
                All land plants preferentially take up <sup>12</sup>C, leading to a relatively low
                <sup>12</sup>C/<sup>13</sup>C ratio (i.e. low &delta;<sup>13</sup>C) in comparison
                with atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Experimental studies (Schubert and Jahren, 2012)
                have shown that the difference between &delta;<sup>13</sup>C in the atmosphere
                and some C<sub>3</sub> plants [i.e. &delta;<sup>13</sup>C = (&delta;<sup>13</sup>Catm
                - &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>leaf</sub>)/(1 + &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>leaf</sub>/1000)]
                depends quantitatively on the relative concentration of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.
                The reason for this behavior has been hypothesized to reflect a CO<sub>2</sub>
                sensitivity of enzymatic activity. Consequently, by relating &delta;<sup>13</sup>C
                in fossil leaf tissues to &delta;<sup>13</sup>C of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere
                at the time the leaf grew (see <a href="/faq/14">General background and some commonalities of
                paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> proxies</a>), paleoclimatologists can reconstruct paleo-atmospheric
                CO<sub>2</sub>. Because other materials such as fossil bone collagen, tooth
                enamel and the calcium carbonate in stalagmites record the &delta;<sup>13</sup>C
                values of vegetation, scientists have also attempted to calculate &delta;<sup>13</sup>C
                from such records. Some of these studies find a close relationship with atmospheric
                CO<sub>2</sub> (Breecker, 2017) whereas others find a closer correlation with the
                amount of mean annual precipitation (Kohn, 2016). Other environmental conditions
                such as plant functional type (i.e. gymnosperm vs. angiosperm) must be constrained
                as well, although in some settings these effects can be small.  Similar to other
                proxies that are based on &delta;<sup>13</sup>C, the carbon isotopic composition
                of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> can thereby be inferred from the &delta;<sup>13</sup>C
                value of benthic foraminifera (see <a href="/faq/14">General background and some commonalities of
                paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> proxies</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                &delta;<sup>13</sup>C as a proxy for paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> has been tested against
                ice core data, and its precision has been assessed by Monte Carlo uncertainty
                propagation (Cui and Schubert, 2016). The C<sub>3</sub> land plant carbon isotope
                proxy has the potential for wide applicability in the fossil record through the
                analysis of terrestrial organic matter, an abundant and commonly measured substrate
                that integrates carbon contributions across a large number of plants. However,
                although the prospect of high-resolution sampling is exciting, the use of bulk
                organic matter also introduces complications because different archives of plant
                carbon (e.g., lake sediments, soils, loess, etc.) record different absolute
                &delta;<sup>13</sup>C values, depending on the respective processes that transform
                raw leaves into the organic carbon that is measured. To circumvent this
                complication, most applications focus on &Delta;<sup>13</sup>C changes relative to a reference,
                such as a known &Delta;<sup>13</sup>C value at a known paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> (e.g., from ice core
                measurements), or an independent estimate of pre-event or background paleo-CO<sub>2</sub>
                (from other proxies), relative to which the CO<sub>2</sub>-change across the time
                period of interest can then be quantified (i.e., ΔCO<sub>2</sub> =CO<sub>2</sub>(t) – CO<sub>2</sub>(t=0)).
            </p>
            <p>
                Other challenges in applying this proxy include: 1) few plants have been studied
                experimentally, and different plant groups might show different responses of
                &delta;<sup>13</sup>C to paleo-CO<sub>2</sub>; 2) atmospheric oxygen (i.e. O2)
                concentrations also affect the carbon-isotope selectivity of the carbon-fixing
                enzyme Rubisco and cause greater fractionation (i.e. lower &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>leaf</sub>)
                at higher O<sub>2</sub>, but this effect remains poorly constrained; 3) although
                the proxy is highly sensitive at low CO<sub>2</sub> (≤300 ppm), its uncertainty
                increases at higher atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Similar to other CO<sub>2</sub>
                proxies, the sensitivity of &delta;<sup>13</sup>C to CO<sub>2</sub> is small at
                ~1000-2000 ppm. Finally, &Delta;<sup>13</sup>C also depends on other environmental variables such
                as water availability and plant community shifts, but very wet environments
                exert rather little influence over &delta;<sup>13</sup>C, and, in favorable cases,
                plant communities can be constrained. These corrections and uncertainties of the
                proxy systematics are reported in the form of propagated error bars of the resulting
                paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> estimates.
