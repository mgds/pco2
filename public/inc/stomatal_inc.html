                In most plants, leaves are directly surrounded by atmosphere. Leaves are also the
                prime site for carbon assimilation (photosynthesis). For these reasons, some attributes
                of leaves are highly sensitive to the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. Starting in
                the 1980’s, scientists observed that the density of stomatal pores often scales
                inversely to the growth concentration of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. These stomatal
                complexes, which consist of the pore and two bounding guard cells, are the main sites
                for gas exchange, taking in CO<sub>2</sub> and releasing O<sub>2</sub> and water vapor (see figure).
                Because both water and CO<sub>2</sub> are essential for plant life, there is strong
                evolutionary pressure for leaves to maximize the tradeoffs between CO<sub>2</sub>
                uptake and water loss. This is why stomatal density is typically low when atmospheric
                CO<sub>2</sub> is high: gathering CO<sub>2</sub> is “easy” when it is plentiful,
                few stomata are required under such conditions, and a low stomatal density minimizes
                water loss. When CO<sub>2</sub> is low, a high stomatal density is necessary to ensure
                sufficient carbon supply, albeit with a higher water cost.

                The response of stomatal density to CO<sub>2</sub> can be measured in living plants,
                often using herbarium sheets with known leaf growth dates or experiments across a
                range of CO<sub>2</sub>. If leaf fossils contain cuticle (i.e. the waxy outermost
                layer of a leaf), stomata can be observed under a microscope because the cuticle
                contains an imprint of the outermost layer of cells (much like a wax seal). The
                calibrated responses from living species can then be coupled with measurements of
                stomatal density (# of stomata per mm<sup>2</sup>) in fossils to estimate
                paleo-CO<sub>2</sub>. A related metric called stomatal index (i.e. stomatal density / [stomatal density + epidermal cell density] × 100)
                is commonly measured instead because it is not affected by environmental factors
                that can change cell size, such as water stress (think of inflating a balloon with
                stomata and epidermal cells drawn on it; as the balloon expands, stomatal density
                will drop but stomatal index will remain fixed). There is also a third associated
                metric called the stomatal ratio, which relates the ratio of paleo-to-modern
                CO<sub>2</sub> to the ratio of fossil-to-modern stomatal density (or stomatal index).
                The stomatal ratio assumes a prescribed response between CO<sub>2</sub> and stomatal
                frequency (specifically, an inverse power law with the exponent fixed at -1),
                calibrated by one pair of CO<sub>2</sub> and stomatal frequency measurements in the
                present-day (for more detailed information, please see Royer et al., 2019). The
                stomatal ratio is most often used when the nearest living relative of a fossil is
                not clearly known (this is most common in the pre-Cenozoic).

                These three proxies based on stomatal frequency have been used in dozens of studies
                to produce hundreds of paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> estimates. These methods are especially
                useful in the pre-Cenozoic, where very few other CO<sub>2</sub> proxies can be applied.
                A general advantage of these proxies is that the material being measured (the leaves)
                was in direct contact with the paleoatmosphere. The proxies are also fairly
                straightforward to understand and implement (no expensive equipment is needed).
                However, these proxies do share some drawbacks. First, they are empirical. That is,
                a calibration is empirically measured in a living species (a one-point calibration
                in the case of the stomatal ratio) and then applied to fossils. The best proxies
                are ones that are based on a mechanistic understanding of the processes that control
                the relationship between CO<sub>2</sub> and the proxy measurements. Second, the
                stomatal responses to CO<sub>2</sub> are often species specific (this can even be
                true for different species in the same genus). This is a problem that generally
                affects all proxies that are produced by organisms. For the stomatal density and
                index proxies, this problem can be minimized by using only fossil species that are
                still alive today. In practice, this means that for the early Cenozoic only a handful
                of species are viable candidates (for example, Ginkgo). Third, calibration studies
                are time-consuming. Indeed, to date, less than 10 species of trees have been calibrated
                for the stomatal density and stomatal index proxies. This means that most of the
                paleobotanical record cannot be used. Finally, many species lose their sensitivity
                at high CO<sub>2</sub> (above 500 to 1000 ppm), meaning that the upper uncertainties
                become unbounded.
