                Estimates of past atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> can be made from sodium carbonate
                minerals formed in ancient saline-alkaline lakes. That is because this class of
                saline minerals contains carbonate and bicarbonate in its crystal structure. The
                amount of dissolved carbonate in the paleolake and the associated partial pressure
                of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> control which sodium carbonate forms. At 1 atmosphere
                pressure and present atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> of 410 ppm, trona
                (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>•Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>•2H<sub>2</sub>O) crystallizes at
                temperatures above ~25&deg;C in modern alkaline saline lakes in North America,
                South America, and Africa. Natron (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>•10H<sub>2</sub>O)
                forms at low temperatures in cold climate lakes, but nahcolite (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>)
                is rare because it precipitates only under CO<sub>2</sub> much elevated above modern
                concentrations (Jagniecki et al., 2015). In modern alkaline lakes with surface water
                PCO<sub>2</sub> similar to global atmospheric pCO<sub>2</sub>, the abundance of
                trona shows that sodium carbonate deposition follows equilibrium thermodynamic predictions.

            <p>
                The laboratory experimental work of Jagniecki et al. (2015)  defined the PCO<sub>2</sub>
                and temperature conditions at which nahcolite, trona, and natron form (Figure E
                left panel). The triple point at which all three minerals are stable in the laboratory
                occurs at PCO<sub>2</sub>=840 &mu;atm (19.5&deg;C). These data show that the occurrence
                of nahcolite in an ancient evaporite deposit can establish a robust lower limit of
                atmospheric pCO<sub>2</sub> of 840 &mu;atm. The addition of NaCl to the brines
                allows nahcolite to form at aqueous PCO<sub>2</sub> as low as 680 &mu;atm, which is
                shown by the lower end of the dashed nahcolite-trona univariant line (halite saturation
                and 19.5&deg;C). Knowledge of the lake brine temperatures at which nahcolite or trona
                precipitated can further constrain atmospheric paleo-CO<sub>2</sub>. For example,
                the lower limit of PCO<sub>2</sub> at which nahcolite precipitates rises substantially
                as temperature rises, from 680 &mu;atm at 19.5&deg;C to 1910 &mu;atm at 34&deg;C,
                referenced to a halite-saturated system). Based on this experimental work, the lower
                PCO<sub>2</sub> limit of nahcolite precipitation can be constrained, but the upper
                limit cannot (i.e. there is no upper limit to the arrows on the figure, left panel).
                In contrast, the occurrence of trona in an ancient lake deposit can establish an upper
                limit of PCO<sub>2</sub>, for example 680 &mu;atm at 19.5&deg;C and 1910 &mu;atm at
                34&deg;C, whereas the lower PCO<sub>2</sub> limit cannot be constrained. Because
                conditions to precipitate trona occur almost throughout the entire Cenozoic, the
                presence of trona has less value in paleobarometry than the presence of nahcolite.
            </p>
            <p>
                The nahcolite proxy necessitates petrographic study of the sodium carbonate minerals
                under consideration, to ensure that the minerals formed at the surface (air-water
                interface) of a saline-alkaline lake and not during burial (Figure right panel).
                Limitations of the nahcolite proxy include the relative rarity of sodium carbonate
                deposits in the geologic record (they are confined to the Cenozoic because of
                weathering/erosion processes), and potential non-atmospheric sources of CO<sub>2</sub>
                such as decomposed organic matter and volcanic contributions, both of which can
                elevate pCO<sub>2</sub> above atmospheric values. Finally, unlike at sea level,
                the partial pressure of a gas (pCO<sub>2</sub>, unit &mu;atm) at higher altitudes
                is not equivalent to the mole fraction of that gas (xCO<sub>2</sub>, unit ppm,
                see <a href="/faq/5">FAQ How are atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases reported? The differences
                between partial pressure and mole fraction</a>), and the partial pressure reconstructed
                from mineral phases in mountain lakes would need to be converted to xCO<sub>2</sub>
                to be comparable to ice core and other paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> estimates. However,
                the mineral stability fields shown in the figure might also change at lower atmospheric
                pressure, and such a conversion would need to be tested experimentally. For more
                information on the nahcolite proxy, see Lowenstein and Demicco (2006) and Jagniecki
                et al. (2015).
