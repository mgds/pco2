Liverworts, along with their close relatives the mosses and hornworts, are one
of the oldest groups of land plants, first appearing in the early Paleozoic.
They are short, have no tissue to conduct fluids (i.e. no xylem or phloem), and
their photosynthetic tissue typically either lacks stomata altogether or has pores
that remain fixed in size and shape. This differs from most other land plants,
whose leaves have stomatal pores that can be opened and closed (see Stomatal frequencies).
            </p>
            <p>
Because liverworts lack functional stomata, they are largely passive with regards
to leaf conductance. That is, unlike most other plants, they cannot change their
leaf conductance (see Leaf gas-exchange proxies) by changing the sizes of their
stomatal pores. CO<sub>2</sub> diffuses into the plant either across cell membranes
or through fixed pores. Similar to marine phytoplankton, the carbon isotopic
fractionation during photosynthetic carbon assimilation is partly controlled by
the amount of surrounding CO<sub>2</sub>. In this regard, the liverwort
&delta;<sup>13</sup>C proxy is a terrestrial “cousin” to the marine phytoplankton
&delta;<sup>13</sup>C proxy (Marine phytoplankton &delta;<sup>13</sup>C). The
higher the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, the stronger the air-to-leaf
carbon isotopic fractionation (i.e. &delta;<sup>13</sup>C increases).
            </p>
            <p>
Similar to the Marine phytoplankton &delta;<sup>13</sup>C proxy, the largest
challenge with the liverwort proxy is modeling the growth rate, which also affects
the plant’s carbon isotopic fractionation. This is done with a photosynthesis
model (for details, see Fletcher et al., 2006) which requires inputs such as
irradiance. Liverwort fossils are relatively rare, which limits the general
applicability of this proxy.
