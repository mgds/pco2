                Liverworts, along with their close relatives the mosses and hornworts, are one
                of the oldest groups of land plants, first appearing in the early Paleozoic.
                They are short, have no tissue to conduct fluids (i.e. no xylem or phloem), and
                their photosynthetic tissue typically either lacks stomata altogether or has pores
                that remain fixed in size and shape. This differs from most other land plants,
                whose leaves have stomatal pores that can be opened and closed (see <a href="/proxiesStomatal">Stomatal frequencies</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Because liverworts lack functional stomata, they are largely passive with regards
                to leaf conductance. That is, unlike most other plants, they cannot change their
                leaf conductance (see <a href="/proxiesLeafGas">Leaf gas-exchange proxies</a>) by changing the sizes of their
                stomatal pores. CO<sub>2</sub> diffuses into the plant either across cell membranes
                or through fixed pores. Similar to marine phytoplankton, the carbon isotopic
                fractionation during photosynthetic carbon assimilation is partly controlled by
                the amount of surrounding CO<sub>2</sub>. In this regard, the liverwort
                &delta;<sup>13</sup>C proxy is a terrestrial “cousin” to the marine phytoplankton
                &delta;<sup>13</sup>C proxy (<a href="/proxiesPhytoplankton">Marine phytoplankton &delta;<sup>13</sup>C</a>). The
                higher the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, the stronger the air-to-leaf
                carbon isotopic fractionation (i.e. &delta;<sup>13</sup>C increases).
            </p>
            <p>
                Similar to the <a href="/proxiesPhytoplankton">Marine phytoplankton &delta;<sup>13</sup>C</a> proxy, the largest
                challenge with the liverwort proxy is modeling the growth rate, which also affects
                the plant’s carbon isotopic fractionation. This is done with a photosynthesis
                model (for details, see Fletcher et al., 2006) which requires inputs such as
                irradiance. Liverwort fossils are relatively rare, which limits the general
                applicability of this proxy.
