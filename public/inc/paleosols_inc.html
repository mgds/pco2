                The CO<sub>2</sub> in the air-filled spaces (pores) between solid particles in
                soils consists of a mixture of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere and CO<sub>2</sub>
                produced by organisms (microbes, plants and animals) living in the soil. A simple
                way to envision this is to imagine a sand dune with no plants growing on it.
                The pores are filled with atmospheric air and thus the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration
                equals the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. Now imagine that
                plants grow on the sand dune. Their roots respire and microbes decompose their
                dead tissues, both of which release CO<sub>2</sub> into the pore spaces. This
                soil-respired CO<sub>2</sub> mixes with the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> in the pore
                spaces. The resulting mixture is termed soil CO<sub>2</sub>. The concentrations
                and carbon isotope compositions of soil CO<sub>2</sub> are controlled by the
                relative contributions and the carbon isotopic compositions of the endmembers
                (soil-respired and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, see Figure a for a graphic presentation).

                        <b>Figure a.</b> A graphical representation of the mixing between soil-respired CO<sub>2</sub>
                        (&delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>r</sub>) and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (&delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>a</sub>)
                        resulting in soil CO<sub>2</sub> (&delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>s</sub>). The relative
                        contribution of CO<sub>2</sub> from soil respiration and from atmospheric air
                        control the value of &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>s</sub>. Therefore, if the
                        contribution from soil respiration (S(z)) and the respired and atmospheric
                        &delta;<sup>13</sup>C values can be quantified, then atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>
                        can be determined. The largest source of error using the paleosol carbonate proxy
                        is in estimating values of S(z). The star denotes that the effect of diffusion of
                        CO<sub>2</sub> through the soil pore spaces must also be considered.

                Figure displays that the stable carbon isotope composition of soil CO<sub>2</sub>
                (&delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>s</sub>) can move back and forth between the atmospheric
                and respired endmembers. The value of &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>s</sub> will be more
                similar to &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>r</sub> if the CO<sub>2</sub> from soil respiration
                (S(z)) is much greater than the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. All else
                being equal, higher atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> results in larger &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>s</sub>
                values (closer to &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>a</sub> values, i.e., &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>s</sub>
                moves to the right on the figure).
            </p>
            <p>
                Calcium carbonate nodules formed in soils record the value of &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>s</sub>.
                Calcium carbonate nodules in paleosols (Figure b) can therefore be used to estimate past
                atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Other required parameters include &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>r</sub>
                (determined from organic matter in fossil soils), temperature (required to
                calculate &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>s</sub> from measured &delta;<sup>13</sup>C
                values of the calcium carbonate nodules, determined using temperature proxies)
                and &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>a</sub> (determined as described above in <a href="/faq/14">General
                background and some commonalities of paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> proxies</a>). Values of S(z)
                are more uncertain and represent the largest source of error for this proxy, but
                they can be approximated from mean annual rainfall (for which there are other proxies),
                the depth of calcium carbonates below the paleosurface and the morphology of the fossil
                soil (based on comparison with modern soils).

            <p>
                The advantages of the paleosol proxy are that it does not lose sensitivity at high
                CO<sub>2</sub> as much as some of the other proxies do, it can be (and has been)
                applied to much of the past 400 million years, and it does not rely on biological
                species effects that might change with the evolution of organisms. The primary
                disadvantage is the large uncertainty related to rather poor empirical calibrations of S(z).
                In addition to calcium carbonate, the iron oxide mineral goethite can be used to
                estimate paleo-CO<sub>2</sub>, although soils precipitating goethite tend to be
                richer in respired CO<sub>2</sub>, so that &delta;<sup>13</sup>C values of goethite
                are less sensitive to changes in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. However, an advantage
                of the goethite proxy is that S(z) is related to the concentration of carbon in the
                goethite, which is measurable. For more information see Breecker (2013).

                        in sedimentary rocks outcropping near Teruel, Spain. The top of the paleosol is
                        marked by the tape measure, which shows approximately where the land surface was
                        at the time this paleosol formed. This paleosol has since been buried by younger
                        sediments and then exhumed and exposed by erosion. The color and structure of the
                        paleosol change gradually with depth. There are abundant nodules of calcium carbonate
                        at about 30 cm giving a ‘rubbly’ appearance. Picture credit: Dan Breecker.
