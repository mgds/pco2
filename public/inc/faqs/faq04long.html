Other asymmetric trace gases in the atmosphere also trap outgoing radiation and act as greenhouse gases. One of the most important ones is the water molecule (H<sub>2</sub>O), which absorbs and emits many frequencies of infrared radiation. Because warm air can hold more water vapor, global warming due to increasing levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> also enhances that portion of the greenhouse effect that is based on water vapor.

Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) is another gas that has steadily increased with cattle ranching, rice cultivation in swamps, landfills and other anthropogenic sources. Global warming also destabilizes permafrost in the Arctic, which releases methane and carbon dioxide as the ground thaws and its frozen organic carbon becomes available for bacterial consumption. Methane is one of the less abundant greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, <a href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends_CH4/">its current atmospheric concentration as measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory on Hawaii is 1896 ppb</a> (parts per billion), and therefore much lower than CO<sub>2</sub> = 411 ppm. However, the immediate warming potential of methane is approximately 30 times more effective than that of CO<sub>2</sub>. This is because methane interacts with the relatively shorter wavelengths of the outgoing infrared radiation, a portion that so far escapes to space relatively unobstructed because CH<sub>4</sub> is still not very abundant. Anthropogenic methane emissions (currently ~6 ppb/year) are rising rapidly, which makes CH<sub>4</sub> a powerful player in the short term. However, methane does not linger long in the atmosphere, it is typically oxidized to CO<sub>2</sub> within less than a decade, in which form it contributes less to global warming, but does contribute to ocean acidification.

In terms of paleoreconstructions, we currently do not have any proxies for greenhouse gases other than CO<sub>2</sub>, which limits our understanding of past greenhouse conditions to some extent. Models of the Phanerozoic suggest that past changes in atmospheric methane exerted relatively little influence on climate compared to CO<sub>2</sub> (e.g., Bartdorff et al., 2008; Beerling et al., 2009) but development of paleomethane proxies is ultimately required to help test this idea. Despite the current lack of paleoproxy information for greenhouse gases other than CO<sub>2</sub>, past and anthropogenic variations in CO<sub>2</sub> are significant, methane ultimately oxidizes to CO<sub>2</sub>, and the addition of CO<sub>2</sub> warms our planet much more than increasing the atmospheric water content in a warmer world. Consequently, although we would like to know more about other greenhouse gases in the geological record, paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations place important constraints on past and future climate changes.
