CO<sub>2</sub> has been on planet Earth since its very beginning, when it escaped from the Earth’s interior to the atmosphere along with other gases such as water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and carbon monoxide (CO) via volcanic eruptions. As a greenhouse gas, CO<sub>2</sub> helps raise Earth’s global mean temperature above the freezing point of water – if Earth did not have an atmosphere with greenhouse gases like H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>, all oceans and water on land would be frozen and there would probably be no life on our planet. In addition to contributing to the natural greenhouse effect, CO<sub>2</sub> is also one of the main ingredients of plant photosynthesis, which we depend on for food and oxygen. Consequently, CO<sub>2</sub> is an essential gas on Earth, and life as we know it would not exist without it.

However, increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> trap energy from the sun, more heat is retained on the ground and the consequence is global warming, which changes weather patterns, including the occurrence and magnitude of catastrophic storms and droughts, and melting of glaciers, leading to sea level rise. In addition, organisms migrate with their preferred temperature regime to higher altitudes and latitudes, including the carriers of tropical diseases such as Malaria, Zika and West Nile virus.

A second twist of rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations is that CO<sub>2</sub> dissolves in seawater and reacts with water to create carbonic acid. This increases seawater acidity (i.e. decreases seawater pH), a process termed ocean acidification for its direction of change (Caldeira and Wickett, 2003). While seawater is unlikely to turn acidic (i.e. pH &lt;7), anthropogenic <a href="https://vimeo.com/8990924">ocean acidification</a> has already increased seawater acidity by more than 25% and is projected to double natural (i.e. preindustrial) acidity by the end of this century if anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions continue to rise unabated. The greater acidity deprives calcifying organisms such as corals, clams and crabs of one of the main building blocks for their skeletons and shells (i.e. carbonate ions, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>), such that their skeletal hard parts grow thinner, malformed, and provide less protection against predators and physical stressors like waves. Scientists are particularly concerned that the double stress of warming and acidification will diminish coral reefs like the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Reefs provide important services to people, including protecting coast lines from waves and storms, but also as paramount nursery grounds for many fishes, including commercially harvested species. Consequently, rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> affects people in many ways, both in the atmosphere and in the ocean.
