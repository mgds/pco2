    Since the industrial revolution (i.e. ~1850), anthropogenic emissions have increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> to over 400 ppm. The last time CO<sub>2</sub> was that high was during the Pliocene, approximately 3 million years ago. Most of Greenland was not covered by ice at that time, and global average temperatures were ~1-2&deg;C warmer.
