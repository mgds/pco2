Scientists have reconstructed atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations as far back in time as the Devonian, which started ~ 420 million years ago (for a recent compilation, see Foster et al., 2017). While uncertainties that far back in time are large and few proxies can be applied to go this far back, maximum atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> has been estimated at ~2000 ppm 420 million years ago and then again ~220 million years ago, during the Triassic. Earlier in Earth’s history, CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations may have been even higher than that (possibly up to many %), but unfortunately fossils and rocks older than 600 million years are rare and there are no proxy-based CO<sub>2</sub> estimates for those time periods. Since about 200 million years ago, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> has declined relatively steadily towards the modern, the last interval of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> occurred during the early Eocene, when CO<sub>2</sub> has been estimated at ~1,000-1,500 ppm (see Figure Product). At that time, global temperatures were up to 14&deg;C warmer than today, and there were no large ice sheets anywhere on Earth.

The best documented lowest CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were 180-190 ppm at the height of the Pleistocene ice ages, i.e. during the last 800,000 years (see Figure Product and Bereiter et al., 2015). These ice ages were interrupted by warm intervals (i.e. interglacials), whose typical peak CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were ~280 ppm, and this is also the approximate value that existed until the onset of the Industrial Revolution, which started ca. 1850. Similarly low CO<sub>2</sub> values have been suggested for the Carboniferous, ~340 million years ago, when extensive swamps prevented the decomposition of plants and trees and the photosynthetically sequestered CO<sub>2</sub> did not return to the atmosphere after the plants and trees died. Finally, theory suggests that land plants cannot survive at atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels below about 150 ppm (Pagani et al., 2009) establishing a minimum possible value for the period of time since land plants evolved (i.e. the Silurian, ~470 million years ago).
