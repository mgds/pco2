Most of the energy that warms Earth is received in the form of solar radiation, and in particular in the form of short-wave radiation in the UV and visible light spectrum (~100-1,000 nanometer (nm) wavelength). Although some of this radiation gets absorbed by ozone in the stratosphere, i.e. ~10-50 km above ground, most light passes through the atmosphere without being absorbed. On our modern Earth with its clouds, glaciers, snow covered ground and other bright surfaces like sandy deserts, approximately 30% of solar radiation is reflected straight back into space. This reflected radiation adds no heat to the Earth. The ~70% shortwave radiation that is not absorbed by ozone or reflected back to space is absorbed at Earth’s surface and in the lower atmosphere. When this happens, the electromagnetic energy is transformed into heat energy, which warms the ground and lower atmosphere. Earth is much cooler than the Sun and according to Wien’s Law, cooler bodies emit radiation at longer wavelengths than hotter bodies. Consequently, the radiation emitted by Earth is predominantly in the longer, infrared wavelength band (&gt;1,000 nm). This infrared radiation now interacts with some of the same gas molecules that previously let the short-wave radiation pass right through the atmosphere. These gases absorb some of the outgoing (i.e. away from Earth’s surface) longwave radiation and then re-emit that radiation in all directions, some of which is directed back down toward the Earth’s surface. Consequently, Earth’s surface receives shortwave radiation from the sun AND longwave re-radiated energy from the atmosphere. The more radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere and reradiated back toward the surface, the warmer the Earth’s surface will be. This is analogous to an insulating blanket that reflects heat on the outside but also traps heat on the inside. We call gases that can absorb and re-radiate infrared radiation greenhouse gases.

            <b>Figure caption:</b> Schematic presentation of electromagnetic radiation wavelengths in the solar system. As an exceedingly hot body, the Sun produces light predominantly in the short wavelength bands, and in particular wavelengths in visible light range can pass Earth’s greenhouse atmosphere largely unobstructed. Once that radiation strikes ground, it is converted to thermal energy (i.e. heat) because Earth emits radiation at a much lower temperature than the Sun and therefore in the longer infrared wavelength band. As infrared radiation wants to escape back to space, it interacts with greenhouse gases such as CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>, and is instead re-radiated back to the ground where it warms the planet.

    Not all gases are greenhouse gases. For instance, in oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) the two O<sup>-</sup> and N<sup>-</sup> atoms are arranged linearly and no matter how much the bond between the two atoms stretches or bends in response to the molecule’s vibration, the electric field of the molecule is always symmetrical. Such gases have no greenhouse properties. In contrast, gas molecules that are made up of different elements, such as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) or carbon monoxide (CO), can have an asymmetrical electric field when they stretch or bend, and the bending and stretching vibrations of such gases are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTvqIijqvTg">variably effective in absorbing and emitting radiation</a>.

CO<sub>2</sub> absorbs and reemits light in the infrared wavelength spectrum, and thereby effectively traps outgoing radiation on Earth, so it continues to warm Earth’s atmosphere and surface. As atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increases, the efficiency of trapping radiation also increases, similar to putting on a blanket that gets thicker and thicker with time.
