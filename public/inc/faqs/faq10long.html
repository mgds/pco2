Global and regional climate does not only change with varying greenhouse gas concentrations but also with the spatial orientation of continents and their position in key geographic regions. For instance, glaciation of entire continents is only possible when climate is cool and when a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UevnAq1MTVAe'>continent is positioned</a> over or near one of the poles (like Antarctica and Greenland today). Once the continent is covered in ice, the reflectivity (i.e. albedo) of that ice reflects a large portion of solar radiation back to space. With both poles covered by ice today, the total albedo of the planet currently reflects ~30% of solar radiation back to space, radiation that would otherwise warm our planet. Similarly, the opening and closing of ocean gateways such as the Drake Passage and Tasman Seaway near Antarctica or the Panama Seaway between North and South America affect global climate via the distribution of heat through ocean currents. For instance, the separation of Antarctica from South America and Australia allowed Antarctica to become thermally isolated. Instead of channeling warm water from the tropics to Antarctica, the modern circumpolar current allows cold water to flow around the continent, allowing Antarctica to cool, and a permanent ice cover did not evolve until the Southern gateways opened some 34 million years ago (e.g., Coxall et al., 2005). Similarly, the land bridge that now exists between North and South America was only established in the Pliocene, about 5 million years ago, and before that time tropical waters could be exchanged freely between the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. The closing of the Panama Seaway allowed more moisture to be transported to the high northern latitudes, and contributed to allow Greenland to build up a permanent ice cap (Haug and Tiedemann, 1998; Lunt et al., 2008).

Although the Cenozoic opening and closing of gateways therefore exerted important influence on global climate, the position of the major continents was rather similar throughout the Cenozoic, and therefore allows the influence of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations on our climate to be assessed from past natural carbon cycle perturbations. Going further back in time complicates comparisons between past and future climate systematics. In addition, much of the paleo-information scientists have gleaned from the geologic record has been retrieved from fossils archived in seafloor sediments. However, in moving continents around the globe, plate tectonics also require the production of new seafloor at mid oceanic ridges, and the recycling of old seafloor in subduction zones. If old seafloor were not consumed to the same extent as new seafloor is being made, Earth would expand, and that is not the case. In subduction zones old, dense oceanic plates nosedive under less dense continental and oceanic plates, and sink into the Earthâ€™s deeper mantle. This process destroys ancient sediments and the oldest seafloor present at the bottom of the ocean today is only ~190 million years old; the oldest continental rocks are about 20 times older. Older ocean sediments that have been uplifted on land are very rare and the lack of a comprehensive sedimentary record &gt;200 million years ago limits the temporal extent of paleoceanographic research.

Finally, the dominant fossils used in paleoceanography today are the shells of planktic foraminifera and the organic remains of haptophyte algae (in particular biomolecules called alkenones). The organisms that produce these fossils only evolved some 200 million years ago, and the carbonate shells that litter the seafloor today only increased in abundance some 100 million years ago (Ridgwell, 2005). Similarly, haptophyte algae only started producing alkenones ~40 million years ago, and paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> reconstructions using the alkenone proxy are therefore restricted to the past 40 million years (Pagani et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2013).
