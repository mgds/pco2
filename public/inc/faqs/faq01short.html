    It depends on how much CO<sub>2</sub>. As a greenhouse gas, CO<sub>2</sub> helps to keep 
    Earthâ€™s global average temperature above freezing, and CO<sub>2</sub> is also an important
    nutrient for plants. Too much CO<sub>2</sub> results in excessive global warming and ocean 
    acidification. Human civilization developed under an atmosphere with relatively low 
    CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations of ~300 ppm. During the last ice age CO<sub>2</sub> was only 
    ~180 ppm and this made Earth colder and glaciers covered much of Northern Europe and North 
    America. These low CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations made it more difficult for plants to grow 
    and human populations diminished during ice ages. In contrast, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
    much greater than 300 ppm causes many problems for society, including global warming, rising 
    seas levels, more extreme weather events (floods and droughts), expansion of tropical 
    diseases to regions that currently do not have them, and acidification of the oceans. For 
    our society, around 300-350 ppm CO<sub>2</sub> is good and much more or much less is bad.
