The best paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> records (from before direct CO<sub>2</sub> measurements in air) are from Antarctic ice cores, which contain ancient air trapped in bubbles in the ice. These continuous records are currently restricted to the past 800,000 years and snapshots of even older times are available to 2 million years back in time (Yan et al., 2019). Over the past 800,000 years the lowest CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations occurred every ~100,000 years during ice ages, with CO<sub>2</sub> ~180 ppm. The highest CO<sub>2</sub> levels were recorded during the last 4 warm periods, or interglacials, with maximum CO<sub>2</sub> ~280 ppm. Prior to 400,000 years ago, the highest CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were even lower, with CO<sub>2</sub> ~260 ppm (Bereiter et al., 2015). These interglacials were also dubbed ‘lukewarm’, due to the slightly cooler temperatures of those warm periods.

In ice cores, temperatures are reconstructed directly from the ice, by measuring the ratio of the rare deuterium isotope (<sup>2</sup>H) to the most common protium (<sup>1</sup>H) isotope in ice (H<sub>2</sub>O, i.e. <sup>2</sup>H<sup>1</sup>H<sup>16</sup>O versus <sup>1</sup>H<sup>1</sup>H<sup>16</sup>O, or D/H). D/H ratios in snow and ice are smaller than in seawater. This is because the heavy deuterium isotope has a slightly greater tendency to condensate when moist air cools, and as moist air travels from the tropics to the poles, the deuterium concentration decreases and snow is predominantly composed of 1H1H16O. When it gets colder (e.g. during ice ages), the relative abundance of Deuterium in snow and ice decreases even further. Based on this proxy, we know that temperatures over East Antarctica, from where the longest ice cores have been retrieved to date, have varied by ~12&deg;C (~22&deg;F) over the ice age cycles of the past 800,000 years. The temperature changes go hand in hand with changes in the recorded CO<sub>2</sub> and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) concentrations, with high temperatures coinciding with maximum CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>, and low temperatures coinciding with minimum CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> (Siegenthaler et al., 2005). However, the temperatures over Antarctica are not representative of the entire globe but only for Antarctica and specifically for the elevation of about 3,000 m above sea level where EPICA (European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica) Dome C was drilled. Temperature varies globally with geographic location and vertically with altitude, and climate change-related temperature changes are larger towards the poles (i.e. at higher latitudes) than they are in the tropics. For instance, when Antarctica cooled by ~12&deg;C during the last ice age, the tropics cooled by only ~3-5&deg;C (e.g., Lea et al., 2000).

Unlike atmospheric gases, which are well mixed around the globe within approximately one year’s time, temperature is spatially not uniform on Earth, and taking Earth’s global temperature is more complicated. To avoid altitude-related differences, global temperature records are therefore normalized to sea level, and many records entering this estimate are derived from marine proxies. A common practice for the last 65 million years of Earth history is to relate deep ocean temperature records from fossil shells of bottom dwelling organisms (i.e. oxygen isotope ratios, &delta;<sup>18</sup>O, measured in benthic foraminifera shells) to mean annual surface temperatures (Hansen et al., 2013). Because the water that fills the deep ocean basins sinks to depth in relatively restricted regions of the high North Atlantic and near Antarctica, deep ocean temperatures are globally relatively uniform and provide a good way to look at changes through time. Using reasonable assumptions on the latitudinal surface temperature gradient, global mean annual temperature can be approximated from such deep-ocean records. These estimates suggest that global temperature was ~3-7&deg;C warmer than today during the Miocene (5-23 million years ago), before Greenland was permanently covered in ice, and ~11-14&deg;C warmer than today during the early Eocene (53-47 million years ago), when proxies suggest that CO<sub>2</sub> was as high as 1200-2000 &mu;atm. In summary, the high CO<sub>2</sub> /warm and low CO<sub>2</sub> /cool trends observed in ice cores also occurred millions of years ago (although the causes of CO<sub>2</sub> changes were different), and corroborate the projection that rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> will cause global warming, melting ice caps and sea level rise.
