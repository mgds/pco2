    Carbon cycles between different reservoirs on Earth, including the atmosphere, oceans, terrestrial and marine biosphere (i.e., plants and algae, animals, fungi and bacteria), and rocks and sediments. When one of these reservoirs releases CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere (e.g., via volcanism or vigorous ocean mixing) or absorbs CO<sub>2</sub> (e.g., via weathering of rocks or increasing photosynthesis relative to respiration), the other reservoirs will adjust slowly to neutralize the change and either absorb or release CO<sub>2</sub> in response. All reservoirs partake in this cycle but the rate at which carbon is transferred between them differs. For example, photosynthesis (i.e. biological CO<sub>2</sub> consumption) and respiration (i.e. biological CO<sub>2</sub> production) act so fast that they affect atmospheric levels over the course of a season, exchange of CO<sub>2</sub> between seawater and the atmosphere takes years to centuries, dissolution of carbonate sediments at the bottom of the ocean thousands of years, and weathering of rocks on land tens of thousands of years. When CO<sub>2</sub> is released quickly, it will accumulate rapidly in the atmosphere; when it is released slowly, the atmosphere will see little change because other reservoirs efficiently buffer the excess CO<sub>2</sub>. Fossil fuels that have accumulated over tens and hundreds of millions of years are now being burned by humans over the course of just a few decades and centuries, and the natural neutralization mechanisms cannot keep up with this rapid release. Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> therefore currently rises at the fastest rate observed in the geologic record since at least 65 million years ago, when the impact of a massive meteorite set the world on fire.
