 Our atmosphere is composed of several gases, with nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and argon (Ar) being the most abundant ones. The combined weight of all atmospheric gases exerts pressure on the Earth’s surface, which equals approximately 1 atm at the sea surface. In this gas mixture, each individual gas has its own (i.e. partial) pressure and therefore contributes to the total pressure. The best way to think about partial pressure is to imagine a collected sample of air in a sealed container. If one removes all other gases except the gas of interest and keeps the temperature and external pressure constant, the pressure measured in the container is now the partial pressure of the gas of interest. For example, O<sub>2</sub> gas makes up ~21% in our atmosphere, and at the sea surface the partial pressure of oxygen can be calculated as pO<sub>2</sub>= 0.21 x 1 atm = 0.21 atm. The partial pressure is a useful measure at sea level, where atmospheric pressure is approximately 1 atm, however, there are small variations in atmospheric pressure from place to place, and atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude as the number of gas molecules decreases (i.e. when air gets “thinner”). For instance, at 1,000 m altitude and 25&deg;C, atmospheric pressure is only 0.89 atm and pO<sub>2</sub> is therefore only 0.21 x 0.89 = 0.19 atm.

    Because the partial pressure is consequently not a constant in the atmosphere, gas concentrations in air are given as their mole fraction, x, which is calculated as the number of moles of a given gas (1 mole = 6.022&times;10<sup>23</sup> gas molecules) divided by the total number of moles of all gases (except water vapor, which also varies greatly with space and time) in an air sample. For example, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is a trace gas in the atmosphere and its mole fraction, for example as measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory on Hawaii, in 2019 is x<sub>CO2</sub> = <a href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/">411 &mu;mol/mol</a>. 1 mol equals 1,000,000 &mu;mol, so that 411 &mu;mol/mol = 411 &mu;mol/1,000,000 &mu;mol can also be read as 411 parts per million (ppm). Because the mole fraction of an ideal gas is equal to its volumetric fraction in an air sample (i.e. volume per volume), the concentration of an ideal gas can also be given in parts per million by volume (ppmv), where, e.g., 1 ppmv CO<sub>2</sub> is equivalent to 1 microliter of CO<sub>2</sub> in 1 liter of air.

Mole fraction and partial pressure are proportional to each other, where p<sub>CO2</sub> = x<sub>CO2</sub> &times; p, and with approximately 1 atm pressure at sea level, p<sub>CO2</sub> and x<sub>CO2</sub> are approximately equal: p<sub>CO2</sub> = x<sub>CO2</sub> &times; 1 atm. This is a useful relationship for the air-sea interface because the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> in seawater (p<sub>CO2</sub>, note the capital P that some scientists use to distinguish partial pressure in seawater from lower case p for atmospheric p<sub>CO2</sub>) increases and decreases proportional to the increasing and decreasing p<sub>CO2</sub> in the atmosphere (cf. Henry’s Law). The quantity that drives the air-sea CO<sub>2</sub> exchange is the partial pressure, not the mole fraction, but as described above, (a) p<sub>CO2</sub> and x<sub>CO2</sub> are approximately equal at sea level, and (b) p<sub>CO2</sub> and p<sub>CO2</sub> are equal in ocean regions where surface seawater and the atmosphere are in CO<sub>2</sub>-equilibrium. Consequently, paleo-p<sub>CO2</sub> can be reconstructed from fossil plankton in such regions. For detailed explanations of marine carbonate chemistry and air-sea gas exchange, see also Zeebe & Wolf-Gladrow (2001).

Because the numerical values of p<sub>CO2</sub> given in &mu;atm and x<sub>CO2</sub> given in ppmv are approximately equal at 1 atm, it does not matter whether one uses the units &mu;atm (i.e. p<sub>CO2</sub>) or ppm (i.e. x<sub>CO2</sub>) at sea level. However, &mu;atm and ppm (or ppmv) are erroneously used interchangeably in the paleo-literature. Strictly spoken, &mu;atm is the correct unit for p<sub>CO2</sub> and p<sub>CO2</sub> reconstructed from fossil plankton (i.e. at sea level), whereas ppm is the correct unit for x<sub>CO2</sub> reconstructed from plant fossils at varying altitudes on land. However, because x<sub>CO2</sub> is a ratio and therefore independent of altitude, the distinction of p<sub>CO2</sub> and x<sub>CO2</sub> has little practical consequence for the reconstructed atmospheric paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations over the Cenozoic, throughout which the total atmospheric pressure was ~1 (Berner, 2006). Although small deviations between p<sub>CO2</sub> and x<sub>CO2</sub> exist due to local differences in temperature, pressure and humidity, these deviations are negligible in comparison to the large uncertainties introduced by imperfect paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> proxies. For the sake of simplicity, these FAQs use ‘CO<sub>2</sub>’ synonymous to ‘x<sub>CO2</sub>’, and this simplification is also found in the scientific literature.
