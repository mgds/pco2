    Climate and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the past cannot be measured directly with instruments like thermometers, rain gauges or spectrophotometers (i.e. the instrument used for measuring atmospheric gas concentrations such as CO<sub>2</sub>). Therefore, paleoclimatologists use surrogates (i.e. proxies) for these quantities, which are not the environmental parameter itself, but which are closely related to that parameter. For instance, different species of plants and animals only occur in certain climates, by studying their abundance in the past, the climate conditions at that time can be inferred. Paleoclimatologists also often study the chemical or isotopic composition of minerals or fossil remains of ancient organisms, which change in response to the environmental conditions under which those minerals were formed and organisms grew.
