    In contrast to many toxins that get more and more potent when their concentration increases, greenhouse gases are more efficient when their concentration is small. That is not to say that greenhouse gases will not continue to warm the planet upon adding more and more of them to the atmosphere, but the degree of warming per added gas molecule decreases with the number of molecules already present in the atmosphere. For instance, let’s assume every doubling of the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere causes a global mean warming of 3&deg;C (a reasonable number for modern climate). Any doubling means that CO<sub>2</sub> can increase from 10 to 20 ppm (parts per million, see also <a href="/faq/5">FAQ Atmospheric gas composition: partial pressure, mole fraction and their units</a> for definitions of partial pressure and mole fraction of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere), from 100 to 200 ppm or from 1000 to 2000 ppm. The number of added gas molecules differs dramatically in this example, but the warming is the same (3&deg;C) for each CO<sub>2</sub> doubling. Consequently, adding a few CO<sub>2</sub> molecules to an atmosphere with a relatively low CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (e.g., doubling CO<sub>2</sub> from preindustrial 280 ppm to 560 ppm, an increase of 280 ppm) will cause greater warming than raising CO<sub>2</sub> from 560 to 840 ppm (also an increase of 280 ppm). An extreme case of a greenhouse effect is present on Venus, where CO<sub>2</sub> makes up >96% of all gases in the atmosphere and the temperature is ~470&deg;C. Even with this massive concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> Venus will continue to warm upon further addition of CO<sub>2</sub>, but the additional warming will be very small. The much smaller atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> on Earth is one of the reasons why the average temperature is much lower (~14&deg;C) than on Venus, but adding a little CO<sub>2</sub> will have a much larger warming effect on Earth than adding the same amount of CO<sub>2</sub> to Venus’ atmosphere. With the small fraction of CO<sub>2</sub> that our atmosphere contains, adding a little more goes a long way towards warming the planet.
