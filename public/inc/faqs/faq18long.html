    In comparison to the long geologic history, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations of 410 ppm today are relatively low, and one might ask oneself why scientists are so concerned about rising CO<sub>2</sub> at this relatively low concentration. Given that Earth has seen similar and much higher CO<sub>2</sub> in the past, one might think that these current greenhouse conditions are nothing out of the ordinary and Earth will be able to cope with them without a problem. This is of course correct, Earth will be fine, but the question is whether humans will enjoy the changing conditions?

To put ongoing climate change into geological perspective, we have to appreciate that the rates of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> release and consequent warming and ocean acidification are much higher than those associated with known natural past events other than meteorite impacts (see also FAQ Why does the rate of carbon release matter?), suggesting that adapting to the changing environment will require swift action by humans, and is already detrimental <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/20/climate-change-and-the-new-age-of-extinction">to many species</a> of plants and animals on land and in the ocean. In addition, if we burn all existing fossil fuel reserves, global temperatures will be unusually hot even in the context of geologic time (Foster et al., 2017). Given that extreme weather events are occurring much more frequently already, and the 10 hottest years on record have all occurred within this century, we will have to consider what this means for life on planet Earth.

Humans have only lived on Earth for the past 3 million years, and modern societies have evolved under the relatively constant climate conditions of the past ~5,000 years. The global rainfall patterns have changed relatively little over that time, and the availability of fresh water is of paramount importance for agriculture and hence the wellbeing of the growing human population. In addition, sea level has essentially been constant, and modern cities and infrastructures have been built in places that may be flooded in the future. Consequently, while Earth and life on Earth in general care little about sea level and where exactly rain falls (i.e., many plants and animals will move and they have started doing so already), adapting to changing weather patterns, to the growing occurrence and magnitude of droughts and severe storms, and to rising sea level will be costly for developed countries, and detrimental to developing countries that do not have the financial means to adapt. Even societies that fortuitously live in regions that benefit from climate change, e.g. due to longer growth seasons and more favorable weather conditions, will have to bear the consequences of climate change, because climate change will uproot hundreds of millions of people, who will get moving to find better living conditions. Undoubtedly, climate refugees will aim to settle among well-developed societies and in conditions favorable for life, so that the consequences of climate change will ultimately have to be borne by the entire globe and by all nations â€“ no matter how much each nation contributed to the ongoing and growing CO<sub>2</sub> problem.
