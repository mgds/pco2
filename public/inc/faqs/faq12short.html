<p>
    Over the last 60 million years, the highest CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations of ~1,000-1,500 ppm have been estimated for the early Eocene, when global temperatures were up to 14&deg;C warmer than today. Prior to the Cenozoic, Devonian and Triassic (i.e. 420 and 220 million years ago, respectively) CO<sub>2</sub> may have been as high as ~2000 ppm.  CO<sub>2</sub> may have been even higher than that (possibly up to many %) earlier in Earth history, but unfortunately fossils and rocks older than 600 million years are rare and there are no proxy-based CO<sub>2</sub> estimates for those time periods.
