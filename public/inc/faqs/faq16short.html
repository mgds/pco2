    All measurements are imperfect, and proxy measurements can be particularly imperfect if secondary proxy controls are not well constrained. Despite this imperfection, many measurements are still useful because they provide information that can be used to make decisions. However, it is important to consider how imperfect a measurement might be before a result is interpreted. For instance, weather forecasting feeds information from instrumental measurements into models. Weather forecasts provide a good example of uncertainty â€“ they are rarely perfect but they are very useful, and they help an individual to decide what to wear or whether to go out for a picnic, or a farmer to decide on the best time for seeding or harvesting. In contrast to weather forecasts, which typically report the chance for a given pattern to occur within some percentage, proxy-based reconstructions typically report a range of possible values around the best estimate. For instance, if a proxy CO<sub>2</sub> estimate reads 515<span style="display: inline-block;vertical-align:middle;line-height:1em;font-size:.6em;">+134<br>-96</span> ppm, that means that any value between 515+134=649 and 515-96=419 ppm can be the correct answer. Even if the value can only be constrained to CO<sub>2</sub>=419-649 ppm, this range is significantly higher than a preindustrial CO<sub>2</sub> of 280 ppm, and thus provides important information.
