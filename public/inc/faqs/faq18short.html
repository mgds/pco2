    Humans as a species are only ~3 million years old and modern civilizations have evolved in a relatively stable climate with atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations of 280-300 ppm. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are now rising more rapidly than at any time in human evolution and modern societies, their agriculture and infrastructure are not equipped to deal with the rapidly changing weather patterns, global warming, sea level rise etc. Coastal ranges that are attractive today may no longer be habitable in the future, water and food supply will shift and diminish the livelihood of hundreds of millions of people. People will be uprooted and climate refugees will aim to settle among well-developed societies and in conditions favorable for life, so that the consequences of climate change will ultimately have to be borne by the entire globe and by all nations.
