In the absence of large-scale carbon cycle perturbations such as massive volcanic eruptions, extraterrestrial meteorite impacts or fossil fuel burning, the natural carbon cycle strikes a delicate balance of CO<sub>2</sub> consumption (i.e. sequestration) by plant and algae photosynthesis, dissolution of CaCO<sub>3</sub> shells at the bottom of the ocean, and weathering of rocks on land on the one hand, and CO<sub>2</sub> release by rotting plant and animal matter, secretion of CaCO<sub>3</sub> shells and skeletons and moderate ‘background’ volcanism on the other hand. If this balance gets disturbed, e.g., by burning fossil oil and gas reserves that have been sequestered over hundreds of millions of years, then the rate of burning determines how much CO<sub>2</sub> can be neutralized by natural processes and how much will end up in the atmosphere and from there dissolve in seawater. As a simple rule of thumb, the faster CO<sub>2</sub> is pumped into the atmosphere, the harder it is for the sinks to keep up, so atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> keeps rising. In addition, a warming climate also makes some sinks less efficient, for instance, seawater holds more CO<sub>2</sub> when the ocean is cold and less when seawater warms, such that global warming diminishes the CO<sub>2</sub> uptake capacity of seawater. More importantly, global warming also allows permafrost and frozen methane hydrates at mid-ocean depths to thaw and release their CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> to the atmosphere. In this case, permafrost and methane hydrates will not only no longer absorb these gases, but they will actually release them, such that they turn from a sink in cold climates to a source in warm climates.

In the ocean, the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> release is particularly relevant for the effect of ocean acidification on marine calcifying organisms (Caldeira and Wickett, 2003; Doney et al., 2012). This is because of the chemical reactions that seawater undergoes when it is acidified by addition of CO<sub>2</sub>. To neutralize the carbonic acid, H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, that is produced when CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with seawater, dissolved carbonate ions react with the hydrogen ions (H+) released from the breakdown of the acid:
</p>
<p>
dissolution of CO<sub>2</sub> in seawater: 	CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O -&gt; H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>
</p>
<p>
    dissociation of carbonic acid: 	H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> -&gt; HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> + H<sup>+</sup>
</p>
<p>
    neutralization of hydrogen ions by reaction with carbonate ions:
					CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> + H<sup>+<sup> -&gt; HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
</p>
<p>
The release of hydrogen ions decreases seawater pH (i.e. acidifies seawater) but the binding by carbonate ions removes free hydrogen ions and neutralizes them, thereby restoring pH. However, the carbonate ion concentration decreases in the process. Unfortunately, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> is one of the main ingredients for the formation of CaCO<sub>3</sub> shells and skeletons by corals, clams and crabs, and diminishing CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations in seawater make it harder for such organisms to secrete their shells by the following reaction:
</p>
<p>
calcification reaction: 		Ca<sup>2+</sup> + CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> -&gt; CaCO<sub>3</sub>
</p>
<p>
This decrease in the ability to calcify is particularly strong when CO<sub>2</sub> is released quickly, over the course of decades to centuries, such as today. In contrast, when CO<sub>2</sub> is released over a time period of tens to hundreds of thousands of years, the dissolution of CaCO<sub>3</sub> shells on the seafloor and the weathering of rocks on land adds Ca2+ and bicarbonate ions, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, to the ocean, which restores the ability of marine calcifiers to secrete their shells. Consequently, the current rapid pace of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is much more harmful to marine calcifiers than geologic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that took hundreds of thousands or millions of years to be completed (Hönisch et al., 2012).
