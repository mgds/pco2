CO<sub>2</sub> is a gas that is used and produced by many processes, including photosynthesis, respiration of organic matter (i.e. respiration) by heterotrophs (i.e. bacteria, fungi and animals), precipitation and dissolution of calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), volcanism, weathering of rocks on land, burning of fossil fuels and concrete production. These processes operate on different time scales and the relative dominance of CO<sub>2</sub> sources or CO<sub>2</sub> sinks determines whether atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations increase or decrease over time. For instance, photosynthesis and respiration processes globally tend to balance each other, such that CO<sub>2</sub> sequestered by photosynthesis is returned to the atmosphere by respiration. This can be seen in the seasonal wiggles recorded e.g. at the <a href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/">Mauna Loa Observatory on Hawaii</a>, which reflect the seasonal greening of boreal forests in Earth’s northern hemisphere.

On geologic (i.e. hundreds of thousands to millions of years) time scales, plate tectonics and the repositioning of continents cause volcanism, mountain building and large-scale climate changes such as glaciation, humid periods (i.e. green periods with intense photosynthesis) and desertification. These processes can create environmental conditions that favor one process over the other. For instance, during the Carboniferous (~340 million years ago), large expanses of wetlands protected dead plant material from microbial decay. Consequently, photosynthesis dominated over respiration, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations dropped to a minimum, and large amounts of plant carbon stored in those swamps ultimately formed the coal beds that we are burning today to produce much of our electricity. This formation of coal, oil and gas deposits takes tens to hundreds of millions of years. Similarly, volcanism releases CO<sub>2</sub> whereas weathering of rocks on land consumes CO<sub>2</sub>, and depending on which process dominates, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations either increase or decrease. For example, massive volcanism at the end of the Permian (~250 million years ago) sent atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> soaring. In contrast, the collision of India with Asia some 40 million years ago created the Himalayas. One hypothesis to explain the subsequent drawdown of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> suggests that weathering of exposed fresh Himalayan rocks is responsible for the progressive atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> depletion to the low concentration characteristic of the last ~15 million years. Finally, cyclic changes to the orientation and shape of Earth’s orbit around the Sun every 20,000 to 100,000 years also affect climate, by changing ocean circulation, algae productivity and thereby CO<sub>2</sub>. Orbital changes are therefore responsible for the cyclic CO<sub>2</sub> variations we observe in ice core records of the past 800,000 years.

After a perturbation of the natural carbon cycle, such as massive volcanism or the anthropogenic burning of fossils fuels, several processes set in to neutralize excess atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. The ocean is the first to respond, it absorbs elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> on the time scale of decades to hundreds of years, and seawater thereby acidifies. This acidification causes deep ocean CaCO<sub>3</sub> deposits (i.e. fossil shells) to dissolve, a process that takes hundreds to thousands of years and also consumes CO<sub>2</sub>. Weathering of rocks on land ultimately restores the low CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations that existed before the perturbation, but this process takes much longer, tens of thousands of years. These are very long time scales when one considers how much societies have evolved over, e.g., just the past 1,000 years.

Currently, anthropogenic fossil fuel burning releases CO<sub>2</sub> from millions-of-years-old geologic reservoirs within a few decades and centuries, and the CO<sub>2</sub> rise is further aggravated by deforestation, agricultural practices and concrete production (e.g., Le Quéré et al., 2016). It has been estimated that the anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> release is 10 times faster than the largest geologic carbon cycle perturbation of the past 60 million years (i.e. the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, Kirtland Turner et al., 2017; Zeebe et al., 2009), and neutralization of excess anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> via weathering of rocks on land will take hundreds of thousands of years. Given the short evolutionary history of humankind (e.g., the Neanderthals went extinct ~40,000 years ago), the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that humans have produced since the onset of industrialization in the 1850s, and that will continue for the foreseeable future (i.e. for at least another century or two), will stay with us for hundreds of thousands of years, and will affect thousands of generations of people (Past to Future, subm.). Consequently, and from the human standpoint, anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will change Earth’s climate ‘forever’ if we rely on natural CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration processes only. Drastically reducing emissions and deploying engineering methods to efficiently remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere can change this prospect, but the effort and cost required to do so increase the longer we wait.
