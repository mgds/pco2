    The total amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere (0.004%) is very small compared to the much more abundant gases oxygen (21%) and nitrogen (78%) but neither nitrogen nor oxygen are greenhouse gases. Despite its small quantity, CO<sub>2</sub> is extremely efficient at trapping heat on Earth and its effect can be compared to a small dose of ibuprofen that relieves a headache (e.g., 200 mg ibuprofen for a person weighing 60 kg) or a tiny concentration of arsenic in drinking water that can make a person sick (0.00001g arsenic per liter of drinking water is the limit recommended by the World Health Organization).
