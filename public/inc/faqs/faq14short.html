    Paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> can be reconstructed from both terrestrial and marine archives. Each proxy comes with its own set of strengths and weaknesses, but what is common to all of them is that they lose sensitivity as atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increases, meaning they provide more precise records at low than at high CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Reconstructions from terrestrial archives are based on (1) the cellular structure and carbon isotopic composition (&delta;<sup>13</sup>C) of fossil leaves, (2) the &delta;<sup>13</sup>C values of calcium carbonate minerals formed in fossil soils, and (3) the presence and absence of nahcolite (i.e. sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3) and trona (i.e. sodium carbonate, Na<sub>3</sub>(HCO<sub>3</sub>)(CO<sub>3</sub>)Â·2H<sub>2</sub>O), two minerals that precipitate in evaporative but non-marine environments under specific CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. From the ocean, paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> can also be reconstructed from (4) the &delta;<sup>13</sup>C of algae biomolecules such as alkenones, and (5) from the boron isotopic composition (&delta;<sup>11</sup>B) of planktic foraminifera shells.
