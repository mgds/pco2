    The Earth system is well equipped to counteract climate perturbations but the processes involved operate on a range of time scales and some of them take as long as tens of thousands of years. The faster we release CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere, the less natural neutralization we get to enjoy on the short time scale of human generations. We are releasing CO<sub>2</sub> so fast that scientists are concerned about the resiliency of society to cope with resulting changes in climate and ecosystems.
