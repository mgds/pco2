    Our atmosphere is composed roughly of 21% oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), 78% nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), 1% argon (Ar) and a range of trace gases such as CO<sub>2</sub>. The relative contributions of each gas to the atmosphere can be given as 1) their partial pressure (e.g., p<sub>CO2</sub> is the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere and is typically reported in units of microatmospheres, &mu;atm) or 2) their concentration (e.g., x<sub>CO2</sub> or mole fraction CO<sub>2</sub> represents the relative quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> molecules compared to all other gas molecules, except H<sub>2</sub>O, in the atmosphere). x<sub>CO2</sub> is typically reported in units of parts per million (ppm) or parts per million by volume (ppmv), which are nearly identical numerically. x<sub>CO2</sub> is independent of altitude, but p<sub>CO2</sub> decreases with altitude, such that numerical values of p<sub>CO2</sub> and x<sub>CO2</sub> are nearly identical at sea level (where atmospheric pressure is ~1 atm), but differ at higher altitudes.
