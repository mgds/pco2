As mentioned in <a href="/faq/13">FAQs What are paleo-proxies?</a> and <a href="/faq/15">Why are there different proxies? Why can’t you just use one?</a>, proxies are surrogates for parameters that can no longer be measured directly; they allow us to glean insight into the past, but they are only related to the environmental parameter in question, and they are not perfect. When dealing with proxies, it turns out that although each proxy is dominantly controlled by the primary target variable, it also often responds to a range of additional environmental conditions. This means that the additional environmental parameters also need to be reconstructed, and the uncertainty of each variable needs to be factored into the total uncertainty of the paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> estimate.

So, what is uncertainty? To go back to our simple example of using peoples’ clothes to infer outdoor temperature (see <a href="/faq/13">FAQ What are paleo-proxies?</a>), consider New York City, where there is no shortage of individuals who defy weather, be it by exercising barely dressed outdoors in frigid temperatures in the winter, or wearing fur-lined boots in the steaming summer heat. These unusual individuals are ‘outliers’, who behave in a way that is inconsistent with our general experience and expectation. When it comes to proxies, there are many such irregularities, e.g., because plankton in some regions prefer certain seasons, whereas the same organism may occur year-round in another location. Also, some proxy-carrier organisms migrate vertically in the water column and thereby record different environmental parameters, and some respond strongly to a local variable that has not yet been identified to exert influence in other regions. These uncertainties make it sometimes difficult to pin a record to a specific time of year, and in the ocean, to a specific water depth. Furthermore, just as much as people differ physiologically (e.g., differences in height, weight, physical and metabolic activity), proxy carrier organisms also display a range of individual physiologies and preferences. When paleoclimatologists establish empirical calibrations between the proxy and its target environmental parameter, the proxy measurement does not always fall on a well-defined line, but there is some data scatter around the line that describes the general proxy trend and its environmental control. In addition, each analysis is also afflicted with analytical uncertainty that needs to be factored into the paleo-reconstruction.

Whether or not a proxy works well is ideally ascertained against a known quantity. For paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> proxies, this known quantity is typically given by ice-core CO<sub>2</sub> records. Because polar ice traps ancient air in enclosed bubbles, and past CO<sub>2</sub> can thus be measured directly from polar ice, ice core CO<sub>2</sub> records over the past 800,000 years provide a bench mark against which paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> proxies can be tested. This is shown in the Figure below, which compares paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> reconstructed from the boron isotopic composition of planktic foraminifera shells to ice core records.

            <b>Figure caption:</b> Example comparison of paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> estimates from a proxy (in this case three different boron proxy reconstructions displayed by green, red and blue symbols, Chalk et al., 2017; Henehan et al., 2013; Hönisch et al., 2009) and ancient CO<sub>2</sub> trapped in polar ice (black line, Bereiter et al., 2015). The symbols display the best estimate for each proxy data point, and the grey vertical bars reflect the proxy estimates’ uncertainty: Each estimate could statistically be as high as the top extreme of the error bar or as low as the bottom extreme of the error bar. While the symbols do not always match the benchmark ice core data exactly, their uncertainties overlap with the ice core data and thereby provide confidence that the proxy data provide reasonable approximations to actual paleo-CO<sub>2</sub>. Note that error bars are larger at the top end (i.e. high CO<sub>2</sub>) than at the bottom end (i.e. low CO<sub>2</sub>). Asymmetrical uncertainties are typical for all paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> proxies (not just boron isotopes), which become less certain at higher CO<sub>2</sub>.

The proxy estimates do not always agree exactly with contemporaneous CO<sub>2</sub> measured in ice cores. However, the proxy data include vertical error bars, which are a measure of the proxy estimate’s uncertainty. The error bars are calculated such that there is a 95% probability that the actual paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> falls within the range displayed by the error bar. This approach is reasonable because the error bars do in fact overlap with the ice core CO<sub>2</sub> data (see Figure). For instance, in the Figure above the best estimates are given by the circles. As an example, we can look at the proxy-CO<sub>2</sub> estimate at 410,000 years ago (i.e. 410 ka), which reflects paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> = 297 &mu;atm. The vertical error bar for that CO<sub>2</sub>-estimate describes that the true value could also be 25 &mu;atm higher or 24 &mu;atm lower than 297 &mu;atm. The ice cores report 283 &mu;atm for the same time interval, confirming that the proxy estimate agrees well with actual paleo-CO<sub>2</sub>.

The uncertainty of each proxy data point thereby takes into account all uncertainties of the individual variables that affect the proxy estimate. Scientists call the accounting for all individual uncertainties error propagation. The uncertainties of different proxies are thereby not the same; some proxies are more sensitive to the parameter they reflect, and the uncertainties grow with the number of ancillary parameters that need to be included in the error propagation. While one may conclude that proxies with smaller uncertainties are better, scientists consider such statements with caution, because the uncertainties of different proxies increase further back in time, and the uncertainties of some proxies, in particular more recently developed ones, may not yet be fully explored. Larger uncertainties therefore do not necessarily reflect poorly on individual proxies but may simply represent a more thorough understanding of this specific proxy’s systematics.

<p>
Several older paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> estimates in our Archive did not provide any error estimate, or reported only the analytical uncertainty of the immediate proxy estimate but no propagation of ancillary uncertainties. The team of experts that compiled and vetted the data presented on this website considered each published record individually and recalculated the uncertainty bounds wherever necessary and possible (see paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> Product).
