    Proxies provide us with an opportunity to study the past but none of them are perfect and it is not always easy to establish whether a proxy relationship holds across a range of environmental conditions. Although most proxies have been calibrated for modern and recent climates, proxy estimates of, e.g., temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> millions of years back in time can differ from each other, and it can be difficult to decide which proxy is most correct. Scientists have most confidence in reconstructions when different proxies (e.g., terrestrial and marine proxies) produce the same results. In contrast, when different (independent) proxy reconstructions disagree, scientists know that more work is needed to produce results that can be relied upon with confidence.
