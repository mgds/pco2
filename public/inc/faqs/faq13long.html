    A proxy is a stand in or surrogate for a parameter that cannot or can no longer be measured directly. For instance, when we hold a thermometer in seawater, the thermometer will read the temperature right now, but it cannot tell us yesterdayâ€™s temperature, or the temperature thousands and millions of years ago. A proxy can help us in situations when instrumental analyses are not possible. For instance, imagine you do not have a thermometer at hand but you would like to know what the outside temperature is. You can look out of the window and infer from the clothing other people wear how warm or cold it is. The clothes are not a direct thermometer but you know from experience that T-shirts and shorts are an expression of warm temperatures, whereas hats and scarves are worn in cold weather; the clothes therefore function as a proxy for temperature.

Paleoclimatologists use a variety of proxies, some are based on the abundance of certain organisms or physical traits of a given organism, others measure the chemical or isotopic composition of minerals or fossil remains of ancient organisms. For instance, trees take up the CO<sub>2</sub> they need for photosynthesis through specialized breathing pores (stomata) in their leaves, but they also lose water through these stomata. Consequently, trees optimize their CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and water loss by having just enough stomata that they can absorb enough CO<sub>2</sub>, but not too many that they lose too much water. This means when atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are high, trees can afford having much fewer stomata than when atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is low; the number of stomata in fossil leaves thereby becomes a proxy for past atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. In reality, this simple relationship is a lot more complex and paleoclimatologists therefore often augment their analyses by including chemical and isotopic signatures of the fossil remains. In the case of plant and algae remains, this often includes isotopes of carbon.

There are many more proxies that paleoclimatologists and paleoceanographers use for reconstructing past atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and other environmental parameters such as temperature, rainfall and biological productivity, but the general idea of all proxies is the same: A proxy is a geochemical or physical characteristic of some geologic material that is closely related to an environmental parameter that can no longer be measured directly. The proxy measurement can be translated quantitatively into an estimate of paleoenvironmental conditions, including CO<sub>2</sub>.
