The geologic record provides an important training set for scientistsâ€™ ability to project future climate change based on future scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions. While modern emissions are driven by human actions, the geologic record presents a range of natural carbon cycle perturbations that allow scientists to gain a better understanding of the different processes that act and respond in the natural world. While the modern trigger is not comparable to past events, the follow-up reactions (e.g. melting glaciers -&gt; reduced global reflectivity -&gt; further warming -&gt; thawing of permafrost -&gt; greater carbon dioxide and methane release -&gt; more warming) and the eventual recovery (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub> release -&gt; dissolution in seawater -&gt; ocean acidification -&gt; neutralization of CO<sub>2</sub> by dissolution of CaCO<sub>3</sub> sediments and silicate rocks on land) will still happen in the future, but they operate on long time scales of decades to tens of thousands of years.

Because of these slow reaction times, such responses are difficult to study in the laboratory and even more difficult to project to future planet Earth. Earth history has done these experiments naturally in the past and studying them allows scientists to efficiently collect a lot of information. Scientists can then use that information to improve their climate models and make better projections for future climate changes. Most importantly, scientists can look for past time periods when atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> was similar to today (or as high as it might be in the future), and study what the climate was at that time.
