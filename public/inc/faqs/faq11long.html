    Ice core records tell us that current atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are higher than they have been over at least the last 800,000 years, and we know that polar ice caps grew and shrank over that time. In comparison to the climate changes observed over the past 800,000 years (e.g., global temperatures ~3&deg;C warmer and sea level ~125 m higher during warm periods compared to the ice ages), current global warming seems small. The reason for this is that the Earth system responds slowly to rising greenhouse gas concentrations. In particular, it takes a long time to melt ice because the white color of snow and ice reflects sunlight and thereby helps to preserve glaciers. The rise of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and melting of the much larger ice sheets at the end of the ice ages took several thousand years, whereas humankind is currently releasing CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases at a much faster rate. Over the last ~150 years atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> <a href='https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/'>has increased</a> by ~120 ppm (see Bereiter et al. 2015 for ice core data), which is comparable to the ~100 ppm CO<sub>2</sub> difference between the ice ages and previous warm interglacials (Bereiter et al., 2015). However, global average temperature has warmed only ~0.8&deg;C since the onset of industrialization, and sea level has risen only ~20 cm in response (for a brief summary, see Doney et al., 2012). To understand what the long-term climate impact of the anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> increase is, scientists can look for times in Earth’s geologic past with CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations as high as today, and study the climate at that time. Such comparisons help to project where our anthropogenically modified Earth climate is heading, after enough time has passed for all processes (e.g., melting of glaciers, ocean heat uptake) to take place.

Paleo-reconstructions of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> suggest that the last time CO<sub>2</sub> was as high as today was about 3 million years ago, during the Pliocene (see Figure Product). Most of Greenland was not covered by ice at that time, and global temperatures were ~1-2&deg;C warmer. The extent to which sea level will rise in response to an ice-free Greenland is estimated at 6-7 m (i.e. 20-23 feet). In comparison, the storm surge that hurricane Sandy brought to New York City in October 2012, and which flooded tunnels, the subway system and the better part of Lower Manhattan, measured only half as much. While some low-lying nations (e.g., Bangladesh) will have to deal with much more wide-scale flooding, this comparison is one example how climate change will affect peoples’ lives everywhere around the globe. Because ice melts slowly, it will take a few thousand years to completely melt the ice sheet on Greenland and most of the ice sheet on Antarctica (Winkelmann et al., 2015), but this is the long-term consequence that future generations will have to cope with.
