As described in <a href="/faq/13">FAQ What are paleo-proxies?</a>, each proxy comes with its own range of strengths and weaknesses, while all of them have been validated under some environmental conditions, almost all of them are subject to post-depositional alteration of the original proxy signal, and physiological species effects (so-called vital effects) often modify proxy signals in biogenic proxies from their physical or chemical theoretical basis. While nearly all proxies have been calibrated and validated in modern systems and relative to ice core CO<sub>2</sub>-records of the past 800,000 years, constraining the individual proxy uncertainties further back in time becomes more and more difficult, because the chemical boundary conditions of each proxy system (e.g., seawater elemental and isotopic composition, &delta;<sup>13</sup>C values of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>) evolved through geologic time, biogenic proxy carriers went extinct and new species evolved. Multi-proxy reconstructions of paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> over the past few million years are relatively consistent, but differences between individual proxy estimates increase further back in time, suggesting that our proxy understanding is not always complete. Comparing independent proxy estimates from the same time intervals therefore allows scientists to probe their respective reconstructions, helps them find secondary proxy controls that may not have been considered before, and provides means to improve the accuracy of each proxy.

Given the multitude of uncertainties that scientists have to deal with in deep time, replicating paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> estimates from independent proxies raises confidence that the reconstructions are indeed reliable, whereas single proxy reconstructions with possibly erroneously small error bars (e.g., because not all controls have been identified), could provide a false sense of certainty. It is therefore important to take advantage of all available proxies, continue to develop new and possibly more accurate proxies, and replicate paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> reconstructions using different proxies.
