    In addition to CO<sub>2</sub>, other greenhouse gases include water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O). The amount of water vapor in the atmosphere increases in a warmer world and therefore responds to climate changes controlled by other greenhouse gases. Scientists currently only have paleo-proxies for CO<sub>2</sub> and we know very little about other greenhouse gases beyond the past 800,000 years that have been studied from ancient air bubbles extracted from ice cores.
