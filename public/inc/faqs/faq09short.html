    Through the study of Earthâ€™s past it is clear that CO<sub>2</sub> and climate are closely related. When CO<sub>2</sub> was high, climate was warm, and when CO<sub>2</sub> was low, climate was cool. This relationship has been observed on timescales ranging from decades to millions of years back in time.
