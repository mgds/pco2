Paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> can be reconstructed from both terrestrial and marine archives. Each proxy comes with its own set of strengths and weaknesses, but what is common to all of them is that they lose sensitivity as atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increases, meaning they provide more precise records at low than at high CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Reconstructions from terrestrial archives are based on (1) the cellular structure and carbon isotopic composition (&delta;<sup>13</sup>C) of fossil leaves, (2) the &delta;<sup>13</sup>C values of calcium carbonate minerals formed in fossil soils, and (3) the presence and absence of nahcolite (i.e. sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3) and trona (i.e. sodium carbonate, Na<sub>3</sub>(HCO<sub>3</sub>)(CO<sub>3</sub>)·2H<sub>2</sub>O), two minerals that precipitate in evaporative but non-marine environments under specific CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. From the ocean, paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> can also be reconstructed from (4) the &delta;<sup>13</sup>C of algae biomolecules such as alkenones, and (5) from the boron isotopic composition (&delta;<sup>11</sup>B) of planktic foraminifera shells.

Marine paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> proxies are based on the fact that the ocean absorbs and releases CO<sub>2</sub> according to its partial pressure in the atmosphere, and some marine plankton store information on the chemical composition of seawater in their molecular and skeletal structures. When plankton organisms die, their dead cells and skeletal structures settle on the seafloor and contribute to ocean sediments. As more and more sediment settles on top, the chemical and isotopic information that the plankton once incorporated in the surface ocean becomes archived in seafloor sediments. By taking sediment cores from the bottom of the ocean, paleoceanographers obtain a time line, with youngest sediments at the sediment-water interface and older sediments deeper and deeper below the seafloor. Paleoceanographers take discrete samples from these timelines and analyze their elemental and isotopic composition to reconstruct the plankton’s ancient growth conditions.

While reconstructions based on marine records translate surface ocean p<sub>CO2</sub> to atmospheric p<sub>CO2</sub> and are therefore presented in units of partial pressure (i.e. &mu;atm), reconstructions from terrestrial archives are retrieved from environmental settings of variable altitude, and their CO<sub>2</sub> estimates are presented as the mixing ratio or mole fraction, x<sub>CO2</sub>, which is reported in parts per million (ppm) or parts per million by volume (ppmv). As described in <a href="/faq/5">FAQ How are atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases reported?</a> The differences between partial pressure and mole fraction, p<sub>CO2</sub> and x<sub>CO2</sub> are approximately equal at sea level, and because x<sub>CO2</sub> is constant with altitude, paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> reconstructions from terrestrial and marine archives are numerically directly comparable and globally representative within their uncertainty bounds.

Several proxies use the carbon isotopic composition of fossil leaves, minerals or biomolecules in the process of estimating paleo-CO<sub>2</sub>. These approaches require knowledge of the &delta;<sup>13</sup>C value of CO<sub>2</sub> in the paleoatmosphere and the most common way to estimate that for the past is by measuring the &delta;<sup>13</sup>C of foraminifera (a group of unicellular marine calcifiers), which is closely related to paleoatmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> because CO<sub>2</sub> is well mixed in the atmosphere and readily exchanges between the atmosphere and ocean (for more detail, see Tipple et al., 2010).

While this approach is generally agreed to be the best approximation at this time, there are several caveats this approach needs to consider, including the preferential (and well known) concentration (i.e. fractionation) of the heavier carbon isotope <sup>13</sup>C into seawater compared to the atmosphere, the geographic variability of seawater-&delta;<sup>13</sup>C across different ocean regions (which can be resolved by focusing on subtropical open ocean sampling), and age differences between samples used for reconstructing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and &delta;<sup>13</sup>C. Reconstructions based on &delta;<sup>13</sup>C in fossil marine biomolecules can fortunately measure &delta;<sup>13</sup>C in foraminiferal shells from the same sediment samples, and thereby ensure that there is no difference in age between the shell and biomolecule measurements. The situation is more difficult for the terrestrial CO<sub>2</sub> proxies, where expert judgment is required to ensure that the marine carbonate is the same age as the terrestrial sample. Fortunately, paleo-estimates of &delta;<sup>13</sup>Catm suggest that for most of the Cenozoic, changes in &delta;<sup>13</sup>Catm were relatively slow, meaning the error in CO<sub>2</sub> estimates associated with aligning chronologies is probably not large.
