    Studying CO<sub>2</sub> in the past helps us understand the Earth’s carbon cycle and the relationship between CO<sub>2</sub> and climate. This information can then be used in climate models to make better predictions of future climate changes. In this regard it is also important to test climate models against reconstructions of climate and CO<sub>2</sub> at different times in Earth history. If a model is parameterized with one set of data and then asked to simulate a different time in Earth history, the model’s ability to match the reconstructions serves as an important quality check. Such tests allow the improvement of climate models and helps scientists to select the best models for their projections.
