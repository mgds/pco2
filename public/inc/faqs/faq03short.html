    Earth’s surface and atmosphere are heated by solar radiation, i.e. sun light, and some but not all of that light interacts with gases in Earth’s atmosphere. Sunlight that is visible to the human eye (i.e. yellow, green, blue, purple, red and orange light) easily passes through the atmosphere and warms the ground and lower atmosphere when it strikes them. If all of this heat stayed there, the planet would accumulate heat and get uncomfortably hot. To prevent that, radiation that comes in must go out, and Earth’s surface reemits heat in the form of infrared light. Infrared light is not visible to the human eye, and in contrast to the visible light that originally came from the sun, infrared light does interact with some gas molecules in the atmosphere, for instance with CO<sub>2</sub>. Depending on how many CO<sub>2</sub> molecules interact with outgoing infrared radiation, some of that radiation cannot escape back to space; it is instead sent back to the Earth’s surface and heats it up. Effectively, some of the radiation that reached the Earth’s surface from the sun gets ‘trapped’ on its way out. Some trapped radiation is important for comfortable life on Earth, without its atmosphere Earth’s surface would be frozen, but rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases like CO<sub>2</sub> warm the planet and this can have uncomfortable consequences when it gets too hot (see FAQ Is CO<sub>2</sub> bad for the Earth?).
