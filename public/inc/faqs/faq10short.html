    In addition to greenhouse gases, the position and topography of the continents also affect climate by determining whether or not large ice caps can build up on the poles (ice reflects solar radiation back to space and therefore cools the planet) and how ocean currents and winds move heat around the planet. To learn from the past and improve projections of future climate-change based on knowledge from the geological record, it therefore makes sense to study time periods when the continental configuration was similar to today. This is broadly given for the Cenozoic, when the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Ocean basins existed and continents were positioned close to where they are today. In addition, the Cenozoic also experienced a range of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations spanning those similar to today (which are already ~40% elevated compared to the past ~2 million years), to those similar to concentrations projected for the end of this century. Earthâ€™s climate system changes much more slowly than the rate at which we add CO<sub>2</sub> to its atmosphere, and studying past intervals with higher-than-preindustrial CO<sub>2</sub> and the corresponding climate at that time provides a fast forward view of the long-term climate consequences of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
