The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> released from combustion of fossil fuels, land use changes (i.e. deforestation, agriculture), and concrete production, as opposed to natural ocean and land CO<sub>2</sub> sinks, is fairly well known and the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increase is in quantitative agreement with the anthropogenic sources minus natural sinks (Le Quéré et al., 2016). On the short time scale since atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations started increasing beyond the typical Pleistocene CO<sub>2</sub> values known from ice cores (i.e. 280 ppm, Bereiter et al., 2015), only major and extended volcanic eruptions could release a similar amount of CO<sub>2</sub>, but no eruptions have occurred that could explain the magnitude and continuous rise of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.

In addition to these quantitative assessments, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> has an unusual geochemical signature that links it to an organic carbon source. Specifically, plants and algae prefer the lighter carbon isotope <sup>12</sup>C over the heavier isotopes <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>14</sup>C, and plant material ends up being isotopically lighter (i.e. enriched in <sup>12</sup>C over <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>14</sup>C; note that <sup>14</sup>C is radioactive and carbon molecules ~50,000 years of age are radiocarbon-dead, i.e. they no longer contain any <sup>14</sup>C).  Because trees and algae form the basic food source for animals and bacteria, and the organic matter of plants, algae and other organisms accumulates in the geological record to form coal, oil and gas, the isotopic signature of fossil fuels is also relatively poor in <sup>13</sup>C and devoid of <sup>14</sup>C, but rich in <sup>12</sup>C. Burning <sup>12</sup>C-rich fossil fuels therefore adds a disproportionate amount of <sup>12</sup>C to the atmosphere, and this signal can be <a href="http://scrippsCO<sub>2</sub>.ucsd.edu/graphics_gallery/isotopic_data/mauna_loa_and_south_pole_isotopic_c13_ratio">traced instrumentally</a> today, but also in ancient air trapped in ice cores and in the carbon isotopic composition of marine and terrestrial fossils. This so-called Suess effect (Keeling, 1979) shows that increasing amounts of fossil fuel burning since the industrial revolution have contributed more and more <sup>12</sup>C to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and the isotopic composition of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (i.e. &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>CO2</sub>) thereby documents the organic carbon origin of the ongoing CO<sub>2</sub> increase. Similarly, the oxygen concentration in the atmosphere <a href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/obop/mlo/programs/coop/scripps/O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>.html">decreases</a> as more and more (fossil) organic carbon is burned (i.e. oxidized), confirming that CO<sub>2</sub> is being emitted by oxidation of reduced (i.e. organic) carbon. Finally, there is also a strong correlation between rising CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and the world population since at least the Industrial Revolution (i.e. since the 1850s), supporting the causal relationship determined isotopically and quantitatively from observations of natural and anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> sources and sinks described above.
