    The known amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by fossil fuel burning, concrete production and land use changes (e.g., deforestation) is greater than the rise of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. This means that natural processes in the ocean and on land absorb a large portion of the emitted CO<sub>2</sub>, rather than contribute to it. In addition, two lines of evidence point to a predominantly (fossil) organic source of the carbon: 1) the observed decrease in atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> indicates that reduced carbon (organic material such as coal, oil and gas) is being oxidized (i.e. burned or respired) and 2) the decrease in the stable carbon isotopic composition of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (<sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio) tells us that emitted CO<sub>2</sub> is sourced from organic carbon (which is enriched in <sup>12</sup>C). Volcanic eruptions can release CO<sub>2</sub> quickly but the vast amount of emitted CO<sub>2</sub> would require massive volcanism on a scale that cannot have gone unnoticed, and the carbon isotopic composition of volcanic CO<sub>2</sub> would not decrease the <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> as observed.
